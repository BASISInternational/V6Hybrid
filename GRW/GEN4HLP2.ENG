The file entered@2needs to have been defined in the Dictionary.  If you are unsure of the@2file, you can enter a wildcard, such as AR.C*, or press the List Files@2key, and General will present a file selection window.@2@2Once selected, the file's dictionary will be loaded, and you will be@2able to build a LIST command by selecting fields and keywords with the@2cursor motion keys.@2The AVERAGE keyword will cause the calculation of a column average, both@2at sub-total and grand-total levels, unless a particular footer has been@2customized with a footer sub-phrase.  AVERAGE must be followed by either@2a numeric field, a numeric calculation, or another aggregate keyword,@2such as TOTAL.@2The COUNT keyword will cause the calculation of a column count, both at@2sub-total and grand-total levels, except when a footer has been@2customized.  COUNT must be followed by a data field, data calculation,@2or another aggregate keyword, such as TOTAL.@2The TOTAL keyword will cause the calculation of a column total, both at@2sub-total and grand-total levels, unless a footer has been customized.@2TOTAL must be followed by a numeric field, a numeric calculation, or@2another aggregate keyword, such as MAXIMUM.@2The MINIMUM keyword will cause the calculation of minimum value in@2column, both at sub-total and grand-total levels, unless a footer has@2been customized.  MINIMUM must be followed by a numeric or date field, a@2numeric or date calculation, or another aggregate keyword, such as@2MAXIMUM.@2The MAXIMUM keyword will cause the calculation of maximum value in@2column, both at sub-total and grand-total levels, unless a footer has@2been customized.  It must be followed by a numeric or date field, a@2numeric or date calculation, or another aggregate keyword, such as@2AVERAGE.@2The PCT-TOTAL keyword will cause the calculation of a percent of grand-@2total for each line in a column.  Sub-total levels will also be@2calculated as a percent of the grand total.  The sub-total and grand-@2total values appear in default footers generated by General, but may not@2appear in custom footers.  This keyword must be followed by a numeric@2data field or numeric calculation.@2The BREAK keyword will cause a line break, with sub-totals if aggregate@2keywords such as TOTAL are used, anytime the value of the next report@2element changes.  Normally, a break field will coincide with the order@2defined in a SORT phrase or an ALTSORT definition, but this is not@2required.@2@2BREAK must be followed by a non-numeric field.  When used with a date@2field, the date may be prefixed by one of the date conversion operators@2	MMYY, MMYYYY, MMMYY, MMMYYY, YY, or YYYY in order to perform a break@2
only when the month or year changes.@2The BREAK-PG keyword will cause a page break, with sub-totals if@2aggregate keywords such as TOTAL are used, anytime the value of the next@2report element changes.  Normally, a break field will coincide with the@2order defined in a SORT phrase or an ALTSORT definition, but this is not@2required.@2@2BREAK-PG must be followed by a non-numeric field.  When used with a date@2field, the date may be prefixed by one of the date conversion operators@2	MMYY, MMYYYY, MMMYY, MMMYYY, YY, or YYYY in order to perform a break@2
only when the month or year changes.@2The SBREAK keyword will cause a line break, with sub-totals if aggregate@2keywords such as TOTAL are used, anytime the value of the next report@2element changes.  Normally, a break field will coincide with the order@2defined in a SORT phrase or an ALTSORT definition, but this is not@2required.@2@2SBREAK differs from BREAK in that it suppresses the printing of the@2break point value as a column on the report.@2The SBREAK-PG keyword will cause a page break, with sub-totals if@2aggregate keywords such as TOTAL are used, anytime the value of the next@2report element changes.  Normally, a break field will coincide with the@2order defined in a SORT phrase or an ALTSORT definition, but this is not@2required.@2@2SBREAK-PG differs from BREAK-PG in that it suppress the printing of the@2break point value as a column on the report.@2The SORT keyword is used to denote the start of a sort phrase.  The sort@2phrase will be in effect until:@2@2     a SELECT keyword is found, or@2     a field phrase keyword is found, or@2     the end of the command is found.@2@2Sort phrases define the sort order for the report, overriding any@2	default sort and also any ALTSORT, ALTFILE, or ALTKEY sort criteria.@2
The sort is defined by the order in which data fields and calculations@2are named in the sort-phrase.  Each element can optionally be prefixed@2by the keywords DESCENDING, which causes that element to be sorted in@2descending sequence, and FULLCASE, which causes text fields to be sorted@2with in a case-sensitive manner (normally, text sorts are NOT case@2sensitive).@2The DESCENDING keyword indicates that the next field should be sorted in@2descending order.  This keyword is only allowed in a sort phrase.@2The FULLCASE keyword is used to force the next field to be sorted in a@2manner that is case-sensitive.  For example, "ABRAMS" and "Abrams" would@2not be considered identical.@2The SELECT keyword indicates the beginning of a select phrase.  The@2select phrase is used to create exception reports, by selecting out only@2records that meet specified criteria.@2@2The SELECT keyword must be followed by one or more relational@2expressions, which themselves are made up of a field or calculation, an@2operator, and another field, calculation, or constant.  Individual@2expressions can be combined with AND and OR to make complex expressions.@2	@2
The select phrase ends when a SORT or field phrase keyword is found, or@2at the end of the command.@2The FIELD keyword can be used to designate that start of a field phrase.@2This can be necessary if a sort- or select-phrase is used, and@2additional field phrase data is desired.  Note that most field-phrase@2keywords will also designate that start of a field phrase also.@2Report calculations can be defined with the @CALC function.  The syntax@2of the function is:@2@2     @CALCname("type-codes","heading",expression)@2@2Each parameter is defined just like in dictionary maintenance.  Once a@2calculation has been defined in this manner, it may be referenced@2elsewhere in the report by its name, @CALCname.@2	@2
Some examples of calculations include:@2@2     @CALC_SHORTNAME("T,L15","Name",MID(FULLNAME,1,15))@2     @CALC_AGE("N,L5,JR","Inv Age",@DATE-INV_DATE)@2     @CALC_DUE("D,L10","DUE DATE",INV_DATE+@CALC_DAYS_ALLOWED)@2This feature causes a report to prompt the user for a value at run-time.@2Within double square brackets, General will look for prompting@2information in one of two formats.@2@2The simplist format is to simply place text between the brackets, such@2as [[Enter starting value]].  The will cause General to place@2exactly what is typed in the command at the point the bracket prompt was@2found.@2	@2
The second format allows more control over the type of information that@2is prompted for, and for conversion of the operator entry to a specific@2data type.  The format is:  [["prompt-text","type","default"]].  The@2type can be T, N, or D, for text, numeric, or date.  The default is what@2General will present as a default value to the user.@2The TAB keyword is used to control placement of the next data element on@2the report.  Tab requires a parameter in one of two forms:@2@2     TAB x will place the next field at column x in the current line,@2     TAB x.y will place the next field at column x, row y.@2The SPACE keyword is used to change the spacing to the next data field@2to some value other than the default of 1.  SPACE must be followed by a@2number between 1 and the width of the report less the current column.@2The NEWLINE keyword (or LF) is used to force the next default data field@2position to be column 1 of the next line.@2The WIDTH keyword is used to override the default number of columns for@2a report.  The default number of columns is 80 for reports to the@2screen, and 132 for any others.@2The LENGTH keyword is used to override the default number of printed@2lines per page.  The default value is 20 for screen reports, and 60 for@2others.@2The DOUBLE-SPC keyword is used to force an extra line between report@2lines.  This keyword is sometimes used in conjunction with the NO-BLANK@2keyword to eliminate extraneous blank lines within a record, but still@2place a blank line between records.@2The LBREAK keyword is used to force a blank line between even sets of@2records.  For instance, LBREAK 5 would put a blank line after every 5@2records.@2The NO-BLANK keyword is used to suppress the printing of blank lines.@2The NO-HEAD keyword is used to suppress the printing of column headings.@2The report title section will still be printed.@2The NO-PAGE keyword is used to suppress all pagination on a report.@2There are no page headings, column headings, or page ejects.  This is@2useful when printing continuous form labels, or when printing fixed@2record formats to a file.@2The NO-DUPLICATES keyword is used to cause the next data element to be@2printed only when it's value changes.@2PROPER is used to convert the next data element to mixed case.  For@2example, the name "JOHN SMITH" would become "John Smith".  There must be@2a text data field or calculation following the keyword.@2UPPER forces the next data element to print in upper case.@2LOWER forces the next data element to print in lower case.@2MMYY is used to convert a date data element to just MM/YY format.@2MMYYYY is used to convert a date field or calculation to MM/YYYY format.@2MMMYY is used to convert a date field or calculation to MMM YY format,@2where MMM is a short name for the month.@2MMMYYYY is used to convert a data field or calculation to MMM YYYY@2format, where MMM is a short name for the month.@2YY is used to print just the year of a date data element, in YY format.@2YYYY is used to print just the year of a date data element, in YYYY@2format.@2Relational expression operator: each value must be equal, except for@2trailing spaces.@2Relational expression operator: the left value must be greater than the@2right value.@2Relational expression operator: the left value must be less than the@2right value.@2Relational expression operator: the left value must be greater than or@2equal to the right value.@2Relational expression operator: the left value must be less than or@2equal to the right value.@2Relational expression operator: the left value must not equal the right@2value, ignoring trailing spaces.@2Relational expression operator: the left value must contain the right@2value.  This is valid only in expressions testing text data elements.@2Relational expression operator: the left value must start with the right@2value.  This is valid only in expressions testing text data elements.@2Relational expression operator: the left value must NOT contain the@2right value.  This is valid only in expressions testing text data@2elements.@2Relational expression operator: the right value is a regular expression@2which the left value must match.  Regular expressions provide extensive@2pattern matching capabilities.  This is valid only in expressions@2testing text data elements.@2The ON keyword is used to direct the report output to a printer or a@2data file.  ON LP will send output to the printer "LP".  ON@2"/usr/john/outfile" will print to the file indicated.  ON PRINTER will@2invoke General's standard printer selection window.@2The EXPORT keyword is used to select an export format, such as Delimited@2ASCII, or DIF.  Normally, the ON keyword would also be used to send the@2export-formatted data to a file.@2The DELIMITER keyword is used to change the delimiter used by the@2delimited ASCII export format.  The default delimiter is a comma.@2NO-QUOTE is used in conjunction with a delimited export, to disable the@2automatic quoting of text data.@2The PREFIX keyword is used to append text to the front of an export@2record format when using the delimited ASCII export option.@2The SUFFIX keyword is used to append text to the end of an export record@2format when using the delimited ASCII export option.@2ALTFILE is used to instruct General to access the primary file of a@2report through an alternate file.  Normally this will result in a@2different sort order, or can allow for a different key range selection.@2@2ALTFILE requires two parameters: a file name, and a key expression.@2ALTKEY is used to instruct General to access the report's primary file@2using an alternate key chain.  ALTKEY 1 would use the first alternate@2key chain, ALTKEY 3, the third, and so on.@2ALTSORT is used to specify the use of a dictionary level sort@2specification.  These sorts are defined as names and replacement ALTFILE@2or ALTKEY keywords.  ALTSORT name will select the name specified.@2ALTSORT ? will cause General to provide a selection window of all the@2sorts defined in the dictionary of the primary file.@2The HEADING keyword is used to override the default column headings of a@2report.@2@2An alternate form of HEADING, HEADINGn, is used to define a custom@2header for the break level n, or the report heading if n is 0.  Any@2fields, literals, and field positioning elements after the HEADINGn@2keyword and before the OFF keyword will be placed in the heading for the@2break level specified.@2The TITLE keyword is used to specify the title of the report.  To split@2a title onto multiple lines, separate the lines with the character@2sequence "^L" or a vertical bar (|).@2PAGE-HDR is used to specify a page heading definition.  Another method@2of doing this is the HEADER0 keyword, which turns on a header sub-phrase@2for the page heading.@2VERT-TOTAL is used to change the standard column oriented sub-total and@2total lines to vertical, descriptive lines.@2LINK is used to define run-time links between files.  Normally, links@2are defined in the dictionary, but may be overridden or added to here.@2Links are used by General when parsing data field references in the form@2"file:field", or nested references "file1:file2:file3:field".  Note that@2in order for General to resolve the link between two files, a link@2definition must be present before the data field references are@2encountered.@2The NO-QUOTE keyword is used to disable the automatic quoting of text@2and date data elements in a delimited export.@2The BEGIN keyword is used to indicate a starting point for the report.@2The starting point relates to either the primary key to the LIST file,@2or if an ALTKEY, ALTFILE, or ALTSORT keyword is used, the starting point@2applies to the sort generated by that keyword.  BEGIN is often used in@2conjunction with the END keyword to define a report range.@2The END keyword is used to indicate the ending point for a report.  The@2ending point relates to either the primary key of the LIST file, or to@2an ALTKEY, ALTFILE, or ALTSORT keyword, if one is used.  When used in@2conjunction with the BEGIN keyword, a report range can be defined.@2This keyword denotes a heading sub-phrase.  Until an OFF keyword is@2found, all fields, literals, and tab placements apply to the heading@2associated with break level "n".  HEADER0 applies to the report heading,@2which appears on the top of every page.@2This keyword denotes a footer sub-phrase.  Until an OFF keyword is@2found, all fields, literals, and tab placements apply to the footer@2associated with break level "n", or to the report footer if FOOTER0 is@2used.@2@2General creates default footers for any report that has break points or@2column calculations, such as TOTAL or MAXIMUM.  There is a default@2footer for each break point and at the bottom of the report.  Using the@2	FOOTERn keyword will override that default for any given level, but will@2
not change any other levels.@2The EVEN keyword is used to generate a numeric break point on an even@2value.  The fragment BREAK EVEN 1000 YTD.SLS illustrates a break point@2in even 1,000 increments of the YTD.SLS field.@2The 1ST keyword is used to generate a break on just the first n@2characters of a text field.  The fragment BREAK 1ST 1 NAME illustrates a@2break point based on the first character of the NAME field.@2The ACROSS keyword is used to specify the number of records to print@2across the page.  If the value is greater than 1, then the WIDTH keyword@2should also be used to specify the width for each record.  For example,@2ACROSS 3 WIDTH 40 would allocate 120 columns for the report.@2@2ACROSS is useful for label printing.  See also the HEIGHT and TESTPRINT@2keywords.@2The TESTPRINT will cause GENERAL to print a specified number of@2"pattern" records before printing live data.  This is useful when@2printing mailing labels or filling in pre-printed forms.@2The HEIGHT keyword is used to specify a fixed number of rows that each@2record will occupy.  This is useful when printing mailing labels,@2especially in combination with the NO-BLANK keyword, to suppress blank@2lines, yet still occupy the correct number of lines per label.@2The OFF keyword is used to turn off a custom header or footer phrase, or@2to turn off a command line link specification (see the LINK keyword).@2The NO-DETAIL keyword, if present, will cause GENERAL to print only@2break point footers and the report footer.  The lines associated with@2individual records are suppressed.@2Enter the name of the file whose dictionary you want to maintain.  If@2the name has not been previously defined, General will ask if you wish@2to create it.@2@2Note that names entered here are just names used to identify a disk@2file.  The name or pathname of the disk file is unrelated to this name,@2and the two need not be identical.@2@2	If you do not know the name of the file, press the List Files key to@2
choose the file from a selection window.@2Enter a description of the file.  This will appear in file selection@2windows throughout General.@2Enter the access level for this file.  The access level can be either a@2number from 0 to 9.  If a user's access level is a number less than this@2number, then access to this file will be denied.@2Enter the disk file or pathname associated with this file definition.@2If necessary, the name can include a run-time replacement or prompt,@2such as "BUBU@COMPANYEUEU".@2@2BUChaining files:EU If several files of identical structure can be@2combined into a single logical database, then you can chain them@2together with a semi-colon delimiter.  At run-time, General will open@2all files and process them as if they were a single file.  For example,@2	"AROPEN;ARHIST" would combine the disk files AROPEN and ARHIST as if@2
they were a single large file.@2Enter any key values that General should ignore when producing reports@2from this file.  The key values should be delimited both front and back@2with a separator, such as "~".  Note that these key values are not@2wildcards or variables, but literals.  An entry of ~01~02~03~ would@2skip the keys 01, 02, and 03.@2Enter a select phrase fragment (one or more relational expressions)@2which General should always use when reporting from this file.  This can@2be used to separate specific record types from a file containing@2multiple record types.@2Enter a value that General will always use as the starting point in this@2file.

Field names may@2be up to 20 characters long, and must be composed of letters, numbers,@2underscores (_), and periods (.).  Underscores and periods cannot occur@2in pairs (FIRST__NAME is invalid, PATIENT_FIRST_NAME is valid).@2@2Press the F2-list fields key to choose the field from a list of@2previously defined fields, or press the up- and down-arrow keys to@2	browse through the field definitions.@2
@2To see the physical data in the file, and optionally to see the field@2definitions associated with them, press the F3-show data key.@2Enter a description of this field.  General uses this description in@2field selection lists.@2Enter the field type code and length, plus any optional parameters.@2Type codes define for General what type of data this field contains, and@2also how to present that data on reports.  To have GENERAL guess the@2definition from physical data, press the F2-guess key.@2@2The basic type codes are T, N, and D, which indicate text, numeric, and@2date data, respectively.  Following that there must be a length code,@2Ln, where n is the number of columns this field will occupy on a report.@2	@2
T,L25 would define a text field of 25 columns.@2N,L12 would define a numeric field of 12 columns.@2D,L10 would define a date field of 10 columns.@2@2Additional parameters are separated by spaces, and are dependent on the@2base field type.  More detail follows.ÿ@2BUText type codesEU@2@2JR or JL       Forces right or left justication.  Normally, General will@2               left justify, but will not trim any leading spaces from@2               the data.@2@2n              The field will occupy n lines.  This allows the splitting@2               of long data across several lines.@2	@2
Additional type codes can be added to the base type and length type@2codes by separating each with a comma.  For example, T,L30,3 would@2define a 30 column by 3 line (90 characters total).ÿ@2BUNumeric type codesEU@2@2JL or JR       Forces left or right justification.

To split a column@2heading across several lines, use the vertical bar (|) where the split@2should occur.  CUSTOMER NAME|AND ADDRESS would produce a two line@2heading.@2Enter an expression that General will use to derive the data for this@2field definition.

The key expression@2     should be enclosed in quotes if it contains any spaces or@2     operators.  If it contains quotes, then use single quotes around@2     the expression.@2Enter the name of the file to link to.  This file must be related to the@2current file by a primary key or a sort definition.  Press the List@2Files key to choose from a selection list.

The name can include@2letters, numbers, and single underscores.  If you need to refer to this@2calculation later in the LIST command, you can simply call it by its@2name.@2Enter the column and row position of the next field or literal element,@2in the format:@2@2          col       column position in current row@2          col.row   column and row position@2\GEN4-KWP\SPACES@2Enter the number of spaces to put between the prior field or literal and@2the next field or literal.  General defaults to one space.@2Enter the number of columns for the report.  If a printer is designated,@2it must be capable of printing this many columns.@2Enter the number of printed lines per page.  Note that this is NOT the@2total number of lines on a page.  When entering a number here, be sure@2to allow for top and bottom margins.@2Enter the number of lines between groupings.  General will place a blank@2line on the report each time this many lines have been printed.@2Enter the name of the file to use as an alternate sort to the primary@2file.  If you aren't sure of the name, use the List Files key.@2Enter an expression to be used by General to derive the primary file's@2key from the alternate file's key.  The expression should use the dummy@2variable K$ to represent the alternate file key.  For example, derive a@2primary file's key from two segments and a literal, the entry might look@2like this: BUK$(1,2)+K$(23,5)+"A00"EU.@2Select the key chain number to use from this list.  The primary file in@2the LIST command will be processed using this key, which can be used to@2derive a sorting order and/or a key range.@2Choose the export type from this list.  Spreadsheets typically can@2import a delimited or DIF format, word processors a fixed format.@2WordPerfect merge is specifically used to generate a file to be used a a@2secondary merge file in a WordPerfect merge operation.@2Enter a delimiter to be used in a delimited export format.  Normally@2this will be a comma, but you can specify any value here.  If you need@2to enter a non-printable value, such as a tab character, enter it in@2General ASCII notation (~009, for a tab character).@2Enter the file name from.  This defaults to the name of the primary file@2for the LIST command.  Link definitions placed on the command line@2override and/or add to those placed in the dictionary, so that any field@2references later in the LIST command can utilize this link.@2@2If you are unsure of the file name, press the List Files key.@2Enter the name of the "link to" file.  This is the target file of the@2link definition.  If you are unsure of the file name, use the List Files@2key.  If this link uses an alternate sort definition, enter the file, an@2"@" symbol, and the sort name.@2Enter the type of link this is.  A "full" type uses the full key to@2access a record in the target file.  A "part" link uses the key as a@2partial key, and scans all records in the target file which start with@2the key value specified.@2Enter the expression used to generate the key or partial key for this@2link.  The expression can contain fields from the "from file"@2dictionary, physical field and record references in the form of @PFn or@2@REC, intrinsic and General functions, and literals.  For example:@2@2     CUST_NO+INVOICE_NO@2     FIRM+"A  "+TERMS_CODE@2     "A"+CHR(2)+LEFT(CODE,5)@2Choose the alternate sort desired from this list.  The primary file will@2be processed in the order defined by the sort definition in the@2dictionary, and any BEGIN or END key range specifiers apply to this@2definition also.@2Enter a value for General to place before each record in an export.  If,@2for example, an export needs to start with an asterisk, enter "*" here.@2If a non-printable character is required, use General's ASCII notation,@2such as ~009 for a tab character.@2Enter a value for General to place after each record in an export.  If,@2for example, an export needs to end each line with "<EOR>", enter that@2character string here.  If a non-printable character is required, use@2General's ASCII notation, such as ~009 for a tab character.@2Enter a value used to indicate a starting point for the report.  The@2starting point relates to either the primary key to the LIST file, or if@2an ALTKEY, ALTFILE, or ALTSORT keyword is used, the starting point@2applies to the sort generated by that keyword.  BEGIN is often used in@2conjunction with the END keyword to define a report range.@2Enter a value to indicate the ending point for a report.  The ending@2point relates to either the primary key of the LIST file, or to an@2ALTKEY, ALTFILE, or ALTSORT keyword, if one is used.  When used in@2conjunction with the BEGIN keyword, a report range can be defined.@2Enter the break level number to associate the header sub-phrase with.  A@2level of 0 indicates the report page header.@2Enter the break level number to associate the footer sub-phrase with.  A@2level of 0 indicates the report footer.@2The primary file for this report isn't a multi-keyed file, so no ALTKEY@2definitions exist.@2Enter the number of records to print across each report line.@2Typically, this is used when printing labels, but any report can be@2printed in this fashion.@2@2GENERAL calculates the total report line length by multiplying the WIDTH@2times the ACROSS values, so it is important to also specify a shortened@2WIDTH value when ACROSS is used.@2Enter the number of records to print as test patterns before the first@2data record is printed.  The test pattern will consist of a format@2matching the first record printed, filled with asterisks.

This@2information is used when presenting user lists for the code entry above.@2Enter this user's access level.  An access level is a number between 0@2and 9.  Higher access levels allow greater access to files defined in@2General's dictionary.  In order to produce a report from a file, a@2user's access level must be at least as high as that defined for the@2file.@2@2Level 9 users are considered "administrative" users.  These users have@2access to the dictionary, configuration, and user definition programs@2	within General, and also have access to all files when running reports.@2Enter a password for this user code.  The password will be required at@2login time, if entered here.@2@2Passwords are optional, and are encrypted, so General has no way of@2knowing what the last password was.

To view the dictionary elements that have been defined for this and@2other physical fields, press the F4-fields key.@2Enter the name for the report.  This name is used to identify the report@2definition, so that it can be later accessed and modified.  If you@2aren't sure of the name, use the F2-list reports key to choose from a@2list.@2@2To return to the main menu, press the F10-exit key.@2Enter a report title.  To split the title on multiple lines at report@2time, use vertical bars, such as "REPORT TITLE|COMPANY X".  This title@2also becomes the description of the report design, and is used in@2selection lists when displayed.@2Enter the name of the file to be used to generate the report.  The file@2must have a dictionary specified, or be defined in a supported external@2dictionary.  To choose a file from a selection list, press the F2-list@2files key, or enter a wildcard instead of a valid name.@2Enter the type code for this report.

Choose the target application@2that is running on your workstation.@2Enter the width for the report, in columns.  GENERAL will only allow@2this report to be printed on devices capable of supporting this width.@2Normally, this will be 80 or 132, but it can be any number from 30 to@2255.@2Enter the number of printed lines per page, making an allowance for@2top and bottom margins.  Normally, GENERAL will calculate this value@2automatically, based on the printer device.  If this entry is left blank,@2then the report will be based on that calculated value.@2@2It may sometimes be necessary to override this number, however, such@2as when a PREVIEW device is chosen, and the default 66-line page is wrong.@2If the report requires that each record occupy a fixed number of rows@2(labels, for example), then enter that number of rows here.  GENERAL@2will force output to this height even of the Print Blanks is set to No.@2@2Normally, the number of rows required is calculated from the data@2printed and the Double Space setting.  Note that entering a height@2parameter will truncate any data printing below the specified lines.@2Enter the number of records to print across a line.  Normally, this@2would be 1, but in some cases (particularly mailing labels), it is@2desirable to print more than one record across the page.  This number@2may be any value from 1 to 9.@2Enter the name of the regular printer to be used for this report, or@2leave this blank to print to the video.  If desired, two special printer@2names are offered:@2@2     PRINTER   will prompt at run-time for a printer, video, or file.@2@2     FILE      will prompt at run-time for a file name.@2@2	     PREVIEW   will print to a file, display the report, and allow a@2
               hardcopy option from that point.@2@2You may also enter a path name here that will be used as an output file@2for the report every time it is printed.  If the path name doesn't@2contain slashes, it must be enclosed in quotes (if it does contain@2slashes, GENERAL will quote it automatically).@2Enter the number of test records to print before actual data begins@2printing.  The test records are formed by making an image of the first@2record printed, and printing it this many times, before continuing with@2the report.  This can be very useful when running labels or pre-printed@2forms with GENERAL.@2@2To have General prompt after each row of test records has printed, allowing@2for more test records or for the report to start, then enter -1.@2If the file selected for this report has alternate sorts defined, then@2you can select one of those here.  When the report is executed, the@2records will be processed in the order defined by the alternate sort@2selected.@2@2When an alternate sort is selected, the "Start with:" and "End with:"@2fields apply to the alternate sort order.@2@2	You can also define sorting for a report with the Sort option, available@2
from the report verification prompt.@2Enter the beginning point to start the report, based on either the@2default sort order for the file selected, or the alternate sort, if@2selected.  If this is left blank, the report will begin with the first@2record on file.@2Enter the ending point to stop the report, based on either the default@2sort order for the file selected, or the alternate sort, if selected.@2If this is left blank, the report will end at the end of the file.@2If you want the report to skip a line every n-th line, enter the number@2of lines to print before each skip.@2If you want the report to stop printing after a certain number records@2have been output, enter the number of records.@2To double space the report, choose Yes.  A blank line will be printed@2between each record.@2Set this item to Yes to force sub-totals and grand-totals to print in@2table fashion, instead of below the columns.  Any customized footers@2will override this setting.  Note that in cases where column formatting@2is impossible, GENERAL will automatically switch to vertical formatting.@2Choose No to suppress the printing of blank lines on the report, except@2for double-space lines.@2Choose No to suppress page formatting, with page ejects and page@2headers.  This is common when sending the report to a file for inclusion@2in another application.@2Choose No to suppress printing of the recap page at the end of the@2report.@2Choose No to suppress printing of detail records, forcing a "totals-@2only" report instead.@2Choose No to suppress printing of column headings in a default page@2header.  The title portion of the header still prints.@2Choose Yes to force a cross-tabulation or summary report, rather than@2a normal columnar report.  Cross-tabulation reports create a summary@2table display based on one or two break points, and column calculations.@2@2A summary table uses one break point, and up to six column calculations;@2a cross tabulation uses two break points and one column calculation.  See@2PLOT in the manual for more detail.@2Enter the number of copies of this report to print.  The default is 1,@2and any higher value will print that many copies of any report sent to@2a file or printer.  Multiple copies are ignored for reports sent to the@2video or PREVIEW device.@2Select the option desired.

This execution is not@2based on a prior condition, as in standard Basic syntax.  If such@2compound expressions need to be logically grouped together, then the@2group operators {} can be used.@2@2	A simple compound expression example:@2
NUM(@PF2)*100; IF @FLD<0 THEN @FLD=ABS(@FLD)@2@2An example of group operator usage:@2IF @REC(1,2)="99" THEN { YTD.SLS=0; YTD.COST=0 };@2@FLD=YTD.SLS-YTD.COST@2Only one link definition per target file name is valid.

The dimensions for the labels can be specified with@2the following keywords:@2@2     WIDTH     Specifies the number of characters per label.@2     HEIGHT    Specifies the number of rows per label.@2	     ACROSS    Specifies the number of labels per line.@2
@2To print 3-up labels, for example, a LIST command could contain the@2keywords SBWIDTH 35 HEIGHT 6 ACROSS 3SF.ÿ@2BUField placement on labels:EU@2@2Use the TAB keyword to place fields on the label at any point desired,@2using substringing if required to truncate any field longer than the@2label width:@2@2     SBTAB 2.2 NAME TAB 2.3 ADDR1 TAB 2.4 ADDR2 TAB 2.5@2     CITY_ST_ZIP(1,30)SFÿ@2BUControlling overall page format:EU@2@2Labels normally are continuous, so that no page ejects or headers are@2desired.  GENERAL makes this "non-formatting" easy.  Just include the@2NO-PAGE keyword and all such formatting is suppressed.@2@2If the labels are to be printed on a laser printer, page formatting is@2trickier.  On a laser printer, page ejects may be necessary, so the NO-@2	PAGE keyword shouldn't be used.  Instead, use the HEADER0 keyword to@2
specify the correct number of blank lines at the top of each label@2sheet, and the LENGTH keyword to specify the total number of lines to@2print per page (overriding any default margins GENERAL uses).@2@2SBLIST ... HEADER0 TAB 1.2 "" OFF LENGTH 64SF, for example, would indicate@2a blank 2-line heading, and 64 lines per page (including the 2 line@2heading).@2Verify that you don't want to save any changes made to the field@2specifications.@2Verify that you don't want to save any changes made to the break@2specification.@2Verify that you don't want to save any changes made to the sort@2specification.@2Verify that you don't want to save any changes made to the criteria@2specification.@2Verify that you don't want to save any changes made to the header or@2footer specification.@2Verify that you want to delete this report definition.
