\\GEN4LIST\ENTRY
Enter your list command by typing, and using the standard cursor
movement keys.  If your command exceeds one screen, General will scroll
up and down as necessary, and you may use the page up and down keys to
move quickly through screens of text.

Your command can occupy many paragraphs.  It doesn't matter how many
spaces or blank lines separate each word in the command, except for
quoted items, in which a blank line equals 80 spaces.  You can also
indent portions of the command to make them more readable.

Once you are complete, press the [Done] key, and General will parse the
command and execute it.

To exit LIST command entry, and return to the main menu, press the Exit
key.  If you have started entering a command, General will prompt to
verify that you want to exit, losing the entry you made.

If you would like to split the screen, and let General help you choose
files, fields, and keywords, then press the Assist key.

If you would like to view the LIST command stack, and possibly copy a
previous command onto the current one, press the History key.

[LIST command overview]

The LIST command is the primary means of producing reports in General. 
A LIST command consists of five parts:

     The word LIST, indicating the start of a report definition.

     A file name, such as CUSTOMERS, or AR.INVOICES.

     A "field-phrase", which consists of one or more fields from the
     file selected, optionally intermixed with keywords, such as TOTAL,
     BREAK, and NO-DUPLICATES.

     A "sort-phrase", which is a list of field names, optionally
     prefixed by sort phrase keywords such as DESCENDING.  The sort-
     phrase is optional.
.page
[LIST command overview, continued]

     A "select-phrase", which a list of expressions that define the
     conditions each record must meet in order to be placed on the
     report.  Expressions take the form of relations between fields or
     between fields and constants.  Examples of expressions include
     YTD.SLS>0, SLM.NAME="JOHN SMITH", CURRENT_BALANCE+100>CREDIT_LIMIT,
     and so on.  Multiple expressions can be connected with the keywords
     AND and OR.

LIST commands also support header and footer sub-phrases, which exist
inside the field-phrase.  These sub-phrases are used to custom define
report- and group-headers and footers.
.page
[Other commands]

In addition to the LIST command, you can directly enter commands to
bypass the main General menu.  These commands are:

PROMPT         Interactive mode for report creation.

STACK          Access to the command history (the last 18 LIST
               commands).

RUN            Re-execute stored commands (saved from STACK or PROMPT).

DICTIONARY     Dictionary maintenance.

CONFIG         System, terminal, and printer configuration.

QUIT           Exit General.
\\GEN4LIST\COMMAND ENTRY

.page
[LIST command overview, continued]

     A "select-phrase", which a list of expressions that define the
     conditions each record must meet in order to be placed on the
     report.  Expressions take the form of relations between fields or
     between fields and constants.  Examples of expressions include
     YTD.SLS>0, SLM.NAME="JOHN SMITH", CURRENT_BALANCE+100>CREDIT_LIMIT,
     and so on.  Multiple expressions can be connected with the keywords
     AND and OR.

LIST commands also support header and footer sub-phrases, which exist
inside the field-phrase.  These sub-phrases are used to custom define
report- and group-headers and footers.
\\GEN4LIST\FIELD PICK
Use the cursor movement keys to move around the list of fields.  Once
the field you want is highlighted, press Enter to place that field on
the LIST command.  If you are in "insert" mode, the field will be
inserted in the command at the current cursor position in the LIST
command; otherwise, it will replace the word at the current cursor
position.

Moving the cursor to the right will move to the keyword selection
window.

Pressing the <delete character> keystroke (typically Ctrl-X) will undo 
selections in the reverse order as made.

Choose Related Files to access data in files which General knows to be
related to the one currently selected.
\\GEN4LIST\SELECT FILE
Enter the filename of the file you want to work with.  The file entered
needs to have been defined in the Dictionary.  If you are unsure of the
file, you can enter a wildcard, such as AR.C*, or press the List Files
key, and General will present a file selection window.

Once selected, the file's dictionary will be loaded, and you will be
able to build a LIST command by selecting fields and keywords with the
cursor motion keys.
\\GEN4LIST\AVERAGE
The AVERAGE keyword will cause the calculation of a column average, both
at sub-total and grand-total levels, unless a particular footer has been
customized with a footer sub-phrase.  AVERAGE must be followed by either
a numeric field, a numeric calculation, or another aggregate keyword,
such as TOTAL.
\\GEN4LIST\COUNT
The COUNT keyword will cause the calculation of a column count, both at
sub-total and grand-total levels, except when a footer has been
customized.  COUNT must be followed by a data field, data calculation,
or another aggregate keyword, such as TOTAL.
\\GEN4LIST\TOTAL
The TOTAL keyword will cause the calculation of a column total, both at
sub-total and grand-total levels, unless a footer has been customized. 
TOTAL must be followed by a numeric field, a numeric calculation, or
another aggregate keyword, such as MAXIMUM.
\\GEN4LIST\MINIMUM
The MINIMUM keyword will cause the calculation of minimum value in
column, both at sub-total and grand-total levels, unless a footer has
been customized.  MINIMUM must be followed by a numeric or date field, a
numeric or date calculation, or another aggregate keyword, such as
MAXIMUM.
\\GEN4LIST\MAXIMUM
The MAXIMUM keyword will cause the calculation of maximum value in
column, both at sub-total and grand-total levels, unless a footer has
been customized.  It must be followed by a numeric or date field, a
numeric or date calculation, or another aggregate keyword, such as
AVERAGE.
\\GEN4LIST\PCT-TOTAL
The PCT-TOTAL keyword will cause the calculation of a percent of grand-
total for each line in a column.  Sub-total levels will also be
calculated as a percent of the grand total.  The sub-total and grand-
total values appear in default footers generated by General, but may not
appear in custom footers.  This keyword must be followed by a numeric
data field or numeric calculation.
\\GEN4LIST\BREAK
The BREAK keyword will cause a line break, with sub-totals if aggregate
keywords such as TOTAL are used, anytime the value of the next report
element changes.  Normally, a break field will coincide with the order
defined in a SORT phrase or an ALTSORT definition, but this is not
required.

BREAK must be followed by a non-numeric field.  When used with a date
field, the date may be prefixed by one of the date conversion operators
MMYY, MMYYYY, MMMYY, MMMYYY, YY, or YYYY in order to perform a break
only when the month or year changes.
\\GEN4LIST\BREAK-PG
The BREAK-PG keyword will cause a page break, with sub-totals if
aggregate keywords such as TOTAL are used, anytime the value of the next
report element changes.  Normally, a break field will coincide with the
order defined in a SORT phrase or an ALTSORT definition, but this is not
required.

BREAK-PG must be followed by a non-numeric field.  When used with a date
field, the date may be prefixed by one of the date conversion operators
MMYY, MMYYYY, MMMYY, MMMYYY, YY, or YYYY in order to perform a break
only when the month or year changes.
\\GEN4LIST\SBREAK
The SBREAK keyword will cause a line break, with sub-totals if aggregate
keywords such as TOTAL are used, anytime the value of the next report
element changes.  Normally, a break field will coincide with the order
defined in a SORT phrase or an ALTSORT definition, but this is not
required.

SBREAK differs from BREAK in that it suppresses the printing of the
break point value as a column on the report.
\\GEN4LIST\SBREAK-PG
The SBREAK-PG keyword will cause a page break, with sub-totals if
aggregate keywords such as TOTAL are used, anytime the value of the next
report element changes.  Normally, a break field will coincide with the
order defined in a SORT phrase or an ALTSORT definition, but this is not
required.

SBREAK-PG differs from BREAK-PG in that it suppress the printing of the
break point value as a column on the report.
\\GEN4LIST\SORT
The SORT keyword is used to denote the start of a sort phrase.  The sort
phrase will be in effect until:

     a SELECT keyword is found, or
     a field phrase keyword is found, or
     the end of the command is found.

Sort phrases define the sort order for the report, overriding any
default sort and also any ALTSORT, ALTFILE, or ALTKEY sort criteria. 
The sort is defined by the order in which data fields and calculations
are named in the sort-phrase.  Each element can optionally be prefixed
by the keywords DESCENDING, which causes that element to be sorted in
descending sequence, and FULLCASE, which causes text fields to be sorted
with in a case-sensitive manner (normally, text sorts are NOT case
sensitive).
\\GEN4LIST\DESCENDING
The DESCENDING keyword indicates that the next field should be sorted in
descending order.  This keyword is only allowed in a sort phrase.
\\GEN4LIST\FULLCASE
The FULLCASE keyword is used to force the next field to be sorted in a
manner that is case-sensitive.  For example, "ABRAMS" and "Abrams" would
not be considered identical.
\\GEN4LIST\SELECT
The SELECT keyword indicates the beginning of a select phrase.  The
select phrase is used to create exception reports, by selecting out only
records that meet specified criteria.

The SELECT keyword must be followed by one or more relational
expressions, which themselves are made up of a field or calculation, an
operator, and another field, calculation, or constant.  Individual
expressions can be combined with AND and OR to make complex expressions.

The select phrase ends when a SORT or field phrase keyword is found, or
at the end of the command.
\\GEN4LIST\FIELD
The FIELD keyword can be used to designate that start of a field phrase. 
This can be necessary if a sort- or select-phrase is used, and
additional field phrase data is desired.  Note that most field-phrase
keywords will also designate that start of a field phrase also.
\\GEN4LIST\@CALC
Report calculations can be defined with the @CALC function.  The syntax
of the function is:

     @CALCname("type-codes","heading",expression)

Each parameter is defined just like in dictionary maintenance.  Once a
calculation has been defined in this manner, it may be referenced
elsewhere in the report by its name, @CALCname.

Some examples of calculations include:

     @CALC_SHORTNAME("T,L15","Name",MID(FULLNAME,1,15))
     @CALC_AGE("N,L5,JR","Inv Age",@DATE-INV_DATE)
     @CALC_DUE("D,L10","DUE DATE",INV_DATE+@CALC_DAYS_ALLOWED)
\\GEN4LIST\[[ PROMPT ]]
This feature causes a report to prompt the user for a value at run-time. 
Within double square brackets, General will look for prompting
information in one of two formats.

The simplist format is to simply place text between the brackets, such
as \[\[Enter starting value\]\].  The will cause General to place
exactly what is typed in the command at the point the bracket prompt was
found.

The second format allows more control over the type of information that
is prompted for, and for conversion of the operator entry to a specific
data type.  The format is:  \[\["prompt-text","type","default"\]\].  The
type can be T, N, or D, for text, numeric, or date.  The default is what
General will present as a default value to the user.
\\GEN4LIST\TAB
The TAB keyword is used to control placement of the next data element on
the report.  Tab requires a parameter in one of two forms:

     TAB x will place the next field at column x in the current line,
     TAB x.y will place the next field at column x, row y.
\\GEN4LIST\SPACE
The SPACE keyword is used to change the spacing to the next data field
to some value other than the default of 1.  SPACE must be followed by a
number between 1 and the width of the report less the current column.
\\GEN4LIST\NEWLINE
The NEWLINE keyword (or LF) is used to force the next default data field
position to be column 1 of the next line.
\\GEN4LIST\WIDTH
The WIDTH keyword is used to override the default number of columns for
a report.  The default number of columns is 80 for reports to the
screen, and 132 for any others.
\\GEN4LIST\LENGTH
The LENGTH keyword is used to override the default number of printed
lines per page.  The default value is 20 for screen reports, and 60 for
others.
\\GEN4LIST\DOUBLE-SPC
The DOUBLE-SPC keyword is used to force an extra line between report
lines.  This keyword is sometimes used in conjunction with the NO-BLANK
keyword to eliminate extraneous blank lines within a record, but still
place a blank line between records.
\\GEN4LIST\LBREAK
The LBREAK keyword is used to force a blank line between even sets of
records.  For instance, LBREAK 5 would put a blank line after every 5
records.
\\GEN4LIST\NO-BLANK
The NO-BLANK keyword is used to suppress the printing of blank lines.
\\GEN4LIST\NO-HEAD
The NO-HEAD keyword is used to suppress the printing of column headings. 
The report title section will still be printed.
\\GEN4LIST\NO-PAGE
The NO-PAGE keyword is used to suppress all pagination on a report. 
There are no page headings, column headings, or page ejects.  This is
useful when printing continuous form labels, or when printing fixed
record formats to a file.
\\GEN4LIST\NO-DUPLICATES
The NO-DUPLICATES keyword is used to cause the next data element to be
printed only when it's value changes.
\\GEN4LIST\PROPER
PROPER is used to convert the next data element to mixed case.  For
example, the name "JOHN SMITH" would become "John Smith".  There must be
a text data field or calculation following the keyword.
\\GEN4LIST\UPPER
UPPER forces the next data element to print in upper case.
\\GEN4LIST\LOWER
LOWER forces the next data element to print in lower case.
\\GEN4LIST\MMYY
MMYY is used to convert a date data element to just MM/YY format.
\\GEN4LIST\MMYYYY
MMYYYY is used to convert a date field or calculation to MM/YYYY format.
\\GEN4LIST\MMMYY
MMMYY is used to convert a date field or calculation to MMM YY format,
where MMM is a short name for the month.
\\GEN4LIST\MMMYYYY
MMMYYYY is used to convert a data field or calculation to MMM YYYY
format, where MMM is a short name for the month.
\\GEN4LIST\YY
YY is used to print just the year of a date data element, in YY format.
\\GEN4LIST\YYYY
YYYY is used to print just the year of a date data element, in YYYY
format.
\\GEN4LIST\=
Relational expression operator: each value must be equal, except for
trailing spaces.
\\GEN4LIST\>
Relational expression operator: the left value must be greater than the
right value.
\\GEN4LIST\<
Relational expression operator: the left value must be less than the
right value.
\\GEN4LIST\>=
Relational expression operator: the left value must be greater than or
equal to the right value.
\\GEN4LIST\<=
Relational expression operator: the left value must be less than or
equal to the right value.
\\GEN4LIST\<>
Relational expression operator: the left value must not equal the right
value, ignoring trailing spaces.
\\GEN4LIST\==
Relational expression operator: the left value must contain the right
value.  This is valid only in expressions testing text data elements.
\\GEN4LIST\+=
Relational expression operator: the left value must start with the right
value.  This is valid only in expressions testing text data elements.
\\GEN4LIST\-=
Relational expression operator: the left value must NOT contain the
right value.  This is valid only in expressions testing text data
elements.
\\GEN4LIST\~=
Relational expression operator: the right value is a regular expression
which the left value must match.  Regular expressions provide extensive
pattern matching capabilities.  This is valid only in expressions
testing text data elements.
\\GEN4LIST\ON
The ON keyword is used to direct the report output to a printer or a
data file.  ON LP will send output to the printer "LP".  ON
"/usr/john/outfile" will print to the file indicated.  ON PRINTER will
invoke General's standard printer selection window.
\\GEN4LIST\EXPORT
The EXPORT keyword is used to select an export format, such as Delimited
ASCII, or DIF.  Normally, the ON keyword would also be used to send the
export-formatted data to a file.
\\GEN4LIST\DELIMITER
The DELIMITER keyword is used to change the delimiter used by the
delimited ASCII export format.  The default delimiter is a comma.
\\GEN4LIST\NO-QUOTE
NO-QUOTE is used in conjunction with a delimited export, to disable the
automatic quoting of text data.
\\GEN4LIST\PREFIX
The PREFIX keyword is used to append text to the front of an export
record format when using the delimited ASCII export option.
\\GEN4LIST\SUFFIX
The SUFFIX keyword is used to append text to the end of an export record
format when using the delimited ASCII export option.
\\GEN4LIST\ALTFILE
ALTFILE is used to instruct General to access the primary file of a
report through an alternate file.  Normally this will result in a
different sort order, or can allow for a different key range selection.

ALTFILE requires two parameters: a file name, and a key expression.
\\GEN4LIST\ALTKEY
ALTKEY is used to instruct General to access the report's primary file
using an alternate key chain.  ALTKEY 1 would use the first alternate
key chain, ALTKEY 3, the third, and so on.
\\GEN4LIST\ALTSORT
ALTSORT is used to specify the use of a dictionary level sort
specification.  These sorts are defined as names and replacement ALTFILE
or ALTKEY keywords.  ALTSORT name will select the name specified. 
ALTSORT ? will cause General to provide a selection window of all the
sorts defined in the dictionary of the primary file.
\\GEN4LIST\HEADING
The HEADING keyword is used to override the default column headings of a
report.

An alternate form of HEADING, HEADINGn, is used to define a custom
header for the break level n, or the report heading if n is 0.  Any
fields, literals, and field positioning elements after the HEADINGn
keyword and before the OFF keyword will be placed in the heading for the
break level specified.
\\GEN4LIST\TITLE
The TITLE keyword is used to specify the title of the report.  To split
a title onto multiple lines, separate the lines with the character
sequence "^L" or a vertical bar (|).
\\GEN4LIST\PAGE-HDR
PAGE-HDR is used to specify a page heading definition.  Another method
of doing this is the HEADER0 keyword, which turns on a header sub-phrase
for the page heading.
\\GEN4LIST\VERT-TOTAL
VERT-TOTAL is used to change the standard column oriented sub-total and
total lines to vertical, descriptive lines.
\\GEN4LIST\LINK
LINK is used to define run-time links between files.  Normally, links
are defined in the dictionary, but may be overridden or added to here. 
Links are used by General when parsing data field references in the form
"file:field", or nested references "file1:file2:file3:field".  Note that
in order for General to resolve the link between two files, a link
definition must be present before the data field references are
encountered.
\\GEN4LIST\\NO-QUOTE
The NO-QUOTE keyword is used to disable the automatic quoting of text
and date data elements in a delimited export.
\\GEN4LIST\BEGIN
The BEGIN keyword is used to indicate a starting point for the report. 
The starting point relates to either the primary key to the LIST file,
or if an ALTKEY, ALTFILE, or ALTSORT keyword is used, the starting point
applies to the sort generated by that keyword.  BEGIN is often used in
conjunction with the END keyword to define a report range.
\\GEN4LIST\END
The END keyword is used to indicate the ending point for a report.  The
ending point relates to either the primary key of the LIST file, or to
an ALTKEY, ALTFILE, or ALTSORT keyword, if one is used.  When used in
conjunction with the BEGIN keyword, a report range can be defined.
\\GEN4LIST\HEADERn
This keyword denotes a heading sub-phrase.  Until an OFF keyword is
found, all fields, literals, and tab placements apply to the heading
associated with break level "n".  HEADER0 applies to the report heading,
which appears on the top of every page.
\\GEN4LIST\FOOTERn
This keyword denotes a footer sub-phrase.  Until an OFF keyword is
found, all fields, literals, and tab placements apply to the footer
associated with break level "n", or to the report footer if FOOTER0 is
used.

General creates default footers for any report that has break points or
column calculations, such as TOTAL or MAXIMUM.  There is a default
footer for each break point and at the bottom of the report.  Using the
FOOTERn keyword will override that default for any given level, but will
not change any other levels.
\\GEN4LIST\EVEN
The EVEN keyword is used to generate a numeric break point on an even
value.  The fragment BREAK EVEN 1000 YTD.SLS illustrates a break point
in even 1,000 increments of the YTD.SLS field.
\\GEN4LIST\1ST
The 1ST keyword is used to generate a break on just the first n
characters of a text field.  The fragment BREAK 1ST 1 NAME illustrates a
break point based on the first character of the NAME field.
\\GEN4LIST\ACROSS
The ACROSS keyword is used to specify the number of records to print
across the page.  If the value is greater than 1, then the WIDTH keyword
should also be used to specify the width for each record.  For example,
ACROSS 3 WIDTH 40 would allocate 120 columns for the report.

ACROSS is useful for label printing.  See also the HEIGHT and TESTPRINT
keywords.
\\GEN4LIST\TESTPRINT
The TESTPRINT will cause GENERAL to print a specified number of
"pattern" records before printing live data.  This is useful when
printing mailing labels or filling in pre-printed forms.
\\GEN4LIST\HEIGHT
The HEIGHT keyword is used to specify a fixed number of rows that each
record will occupy.  This is useful when printing mailing labels,
especially in combination with the NO-BLANK keyword, to suppress blank
lines, yet still occupy the correct number of lines per label.
\\GEN4LIST\OFF
The OFF keyword is used to turn off a custom header or footer phrase, or
to turn off a command line link specification (see the LINK keyword).
\\GEN4LIST\NO-DETAIL
The NO-DETAIL keyword, if present, will cause GENERAL to print only
break point footers and the report footer.  The lines associated with
individual records are suppressed.
\\GEN4DICT\FILE NAME
Enter the name of the file whose dictionary you want to maintain.  If
the name has not been previously defined, General will ask if you wish
to create it.

Note that names entered here are just names used to identify a disk
file.  The name or pathname of the disk file is unrelated to this name,
and the two need not be identical.

If you do not know the name of the file, press the List Files key to
choose the file from a selection window.
\\GEN4DICT\FILE DESCRIPTION
Enter a description of the file.  This will appear in file selection
windows throughout General.
\\GEN4DICT\ACCESS LEVEL
Enter the access level for this file.  The access level can be either a
number from 0 to 9.  If a user's access level is a number less than this
number, then access to this file will be denied.
\\GEN4DICT\DISK FILE
Enter the disk file or pathname associated with this file definition. 
If necessary, the name can include a run-time replacement or prompt,
such as "[[@COMPANY]]".

[Chaining files:] If several files of identical structure can be
combined into a single logical database, then you can chain them
together with a semi-colon delimiter.  At run-time, General will open
all files and process them as if they were a single file.  For example,
"AROPEN;ARHIST" would combine the disk files AROPEN and ARHIST as if
they were a single large file.
\\GEN4DICT\SKIP KEYS
Enter any key values that General should ignore when producing reports
from this file.  The key values should be delimited both front and back
with a separator, such as "\~".  Note that these key values are not
wildcards or variables, but literals.  An entry of \~01\~02\~03\~ would
skip the keys 01, 02, and 03.
\\GEN4DICT\AUTO SELECT
Enter a select phrase fragment (one or more relational expressions)
which General should always use when reporting from this file.  This can
be used to separate specific record types from a file containing
multiple record types.
\\GEN4DICT\AUTO BEGIN
Enter a value that General will always use as the starting point in this
file.  This may contain a run-time replacement or prompt.  For example,
to always process the file beginning with a specific company code, enter
a prompt such as [[Enter company code]].

If the user also enters a BEGIN keyword value on a report, that value
will be added to this value to form the beginning key value for the
report.
\\GEN4DICT\AUTO END
Enter a value that General will always use as the ending point in this
file.  If a user also enters an END keyword value in a report, then the
user's value will be added to this value to form the ending point of the
range.
\\GEN4DICT\OPTION
Yes       {Save the dictionary header as shown.}

No        {Maintain the dictionary header.}

Fields    {Maintain data field definitions and calculations.}

Sorts     {Maintain ALTSORT definitions (alternate keys and files).}

Links     {Maintain link definitions, which describe how this file is
          related to other files in the dictionary.}

Delete    {Delete this dictionary definitions, including fields, sorts,
          and links.}

Print     {Print a hardcopy of this dictionary definition.}
\\GEN4DICT\OKAY
Yes  {Save the definition as displayed.}
No   {Maintain the definition.}
\\GEN4DICT\ABORT?
No   {You do NOT want to lose your changes.}
Yes  {Your changes will not be saved.}
\\GEN4DICT\FIELD NAME
Enter the field name you wish to define or maintain, or press the List
Fields key to choose the field from a selection list.  Field names may
be up to 20 characters long, and must be composed of letters, numbers,
underscores (_), and periods (.).  Underscores and periods cannot occur
in pairs (FIRST__NAME is invalid, PATIENT_FIRST_NAME is valid).

Press the F2-list fields key to choose the field from a list of
previously defined fields, or press the up- and down-arrow keys to
browse through the field definitions.

To see the physical data in the file, and optionally to see the field
definitions associated with them, press the F3-show data key.
\\GEN4DICT\FIELD DESC
Enter a description of this field.  General uses this description in
field selection lists.
\\GEN4DICT\FIELD TYPE
Enter the field type code and length, plus any optional parameters. 
Type codes define for General what type of data this field contains, and
also how to present that data on reports.  To have GENERAL guess the
definition from physical data, press the F2-guess key.

The basic type codes are T, N, and D, which indicate text, numeric, and
date data, respectively.  Following that there must be a length code,
Ln, where n is the number of columns this field will occupy on a report. 

T,L25 would define a text field of 25 columns.
N,L12 would define a numeric field of 12 columns.
D,L10 would define a date field of 10 columns.

Additional parameters are separated by spaces, and are dependent on the
base field type.  More detail follows.
.page
[Text type codes]

JR or JL       Forces right or left justication.  Normally, General will
               left justify, but will not trim any leading spaces from
               the data.

n              The field will occupy n lines.  This allows the splitting
               of long data across several lines.

Additional type codes can be added to the base type and length type
codes by separating each with a comma.  For example, T,L30,3 would
define a 30 column by 3 line (90 characters total).
.page
[Numeric type codes]

JL or JR       Forces left or right justification.  Normally numeric
               fields are right justified.

n              Print field with n decimal precision.

P              Print the field punctuated (with thousands separators).

-,CR,(), or $  Use trailing minus sign, trailing CR, or enclosing
               parenthesis for negative numbers, or use currency
               formatting as defined in the system configuration.  The
               default is a leading minus sign.

Sn             Scale the number by a factor of n.  Scaling is used for
               data containing an implied decimal.
.page
[Date type codes]

JR or JL       Force left or right justification of the data.

T              This is a date and time field, where time is stored in
               the data as a fraction of a day.
\\GEN4DICT\FIELD HEAD
Enter the text to use by default as a column heading.  To split a column
heading across several lines, use the vertical bar (|) where the split
should occur.  CUSTOMER NAME|AND ADDRESS would produce a two line
heading.
\\GEN4DICT\FIELD EXPRESSION
Enter an expression that General will use to derive the data for this
field definition.  Expressions can be a simple as a physical field
reference or can include multiple statements with embedded Basic and
General functions, IF .. THEN .. ELSE logic, and so on.

[Data references]

Data can be referenced in the expression in four ways: 

     as a physical field (from 1 to 255) by using the name @PFn, where n
     is the physical field number,

     as a data record, using the name @REC,

     as the primary key, using the name @KEY,

     or as another field in this file, by using its name.
.page
[Syntax examples]

@PF3 {simple field reference, text or implied numeric}

&DATE_CONVERT(MID(@PF3,7,6)) {user defined function, MID function}

NUM(@PF4)+NUM(@PF5)+NUM(@PF6)  {combined numeric fields}

@REC(11,30) {record substring reference}

IF YTD.SLS>0 THEN @FLD=100*(YTD.SLS-YTD.COST)/YTD.SLS ELSE @FLD=0;
@FLD=MAX(99.99,@FLD) {compound, conditional, field name references}
.page
[Functions]

General allows the use of both intrinsic Basic functions as well as
several pre-defined functions that perform more complex precedures and
return value.  Nearly all Basic functions can be entered in the
expression just as in standard Basic syntax.  General functions include:

     &x(), &x$(), user-defined function named x
     @BREAKn, the break value for break level n
     @DATE, today's date in julian

.page
[Conditional Logic]

Normally, an expression will simply represent a fragment of a full Basic
LET statement, but if the expression begins with IF, then it is treated
as a complete statement.  Conditional expressions must take the form of:

IF relational-expression THEN assignment

                      or

IF expression THEN assignment-1 ELSE assignment-2

Examples:

IF CODE>"" THEN @FLD=EXPAND(CODE,"Y,N","YES,NO") ELSE @FLD="NEITHER"
.page
[Compound expressions]

Multiple statements may be separated by semi-colons, in which case
General will execute each statement in turn.  This execution is not
based on a prior condition, as in standard Basic syntax.  If such
compound expressions need to be logically grouped together, then the
group operators \{\} can be used.

A simple compound expression example:
NUM(@PF2)*100; IF @FLD<0 THEN @FLD=ABS(@FLD)

An example of group operator usage:
IF @REC(1,2)="99" THEN \{ YTD.SLS=0; YTD.COST=0 \}; 
@FLD=YTD.SLS-YTD.COST
\\GEN4DICT\PASTE OPTION
Choose a option to select from a list.  When an element is selected from
one of the lists generated, it will be pasted back into the expression.
\\GEN4DICT\VERIFY FIELD
Yes       {Save the field definition as displayed}
No        {Modify the field definition}
Delete    {Delete the field definition}

Pressing the Exit key will abort this definition without saving it.
\\GEN4DICT\NEW FIELD?
Verify that this is a new field definition.

No        {This is NOT a new field.}
Yes       {This IS a new field, and you wish to create the definition.}
Copy      {Copy this field from another}
\\GEN4DICT\ALTSORT NAME
Enter the name that identifies this ALTSORT definition.
\\GEN4DICT\ALTSORT DESC
Enter a description of this definition.  General will use this when
displaying selection lists of ALTSORT definitions.
\\GEN4DICT\ALTSORT EXP
Enter a replacement ALTFILE or ALTKEY expression for General to use when
this ALTSORT name is selected in a report.  The syntax for these
expressions is:

     ALTKEY n, where n is the key chain number to use

     ALTFILE file-name "key-exp", where file-name is a General file name
     that references the sort file, and key-exp is an expression, using
     K$ as a variable to represent the key of the alternate file, that
     produces the key of the primary file.  Examples of key expressions
     might be K$(21,5), or K$(1,2)+"A"+K$(12,10).  The key expression
     should be enclosed in quotes if it contains any spaces or
     operators.  If it contains quotes, then use single quotes around
     the expression.
\\GEN4DICT\LINK FILE
Enter the name of the file to link to.  This file must be related to the
current file by a primary key or a sort definition.  Press the List
Files key to choose from a selection list.  If the file is related via a
sort definition, enter the file name, a @ symbol, and the sort name,
such as INVOICES@SLSP.
\\GEN4DICT\LINK TYPE
1    {There is a one-to-one relationship between the files, and the key
     expression supplied is a full key to the target file.}

2    {There is a one-to-many relationship, and the key supplied is a
     partial key used to scan 0 or more records in the target file.}
\\GEN4DICT\LINK EXPRESSION
Enter an expression that produces the key required for the full or
partial lookup.  The key produced should coincide with the value
required based on the target file's primary key or on the sort name
selected.
\\GEN4DICT\INVALID NAME
General file and field names can contain only letters, digits,
underscores, and periods.  They cannot contain embedded spaces, and
cannot exceed 20 characters.
\\GEN4DICT\NEW DESIGN?
Verify that this is a new file definition.
\\GEN4DICT\CAN'T ACCESS
The file name selected is unavailable.  Probably another user is
maintaining it's dictionary definition.
\\GEN4DICT\DELETE?
Verify that you want to delete this file definition.
\\GEN4DICT\ABORT?
Verify that you want to lose the changes made to the definition header.
\\GEN4DICT\INVALID TYPE
The type codes must begin with T, N, or D, and must be followed with a
length (Ln) code, and any optional valid type codes for the base type
selected.
\\GEN4DICT\SYNTAX ERROR
There is an error in the expression entered.  General cannot use this
field on a report if there is an error in the expression.
\\GEN4STCK\SELECT
Move the highlight to the desired command, using the cursor motion keys. 
Once the proper command is highlighted, 

     press Enter to execute the command,
     press the Edit key to modify the command, or
     press the Save key to save this command permanently.

If the command is too long to fit entirely in the selection window, it
will end in "...", and once selected to execute, General will display
the full command for verification.
\\GEN4STCK\CORRECT COMMAND
Verify that the command displayed is the correct one.
\\GEN4MAIN\MENU SELECTION
[To choose an option:]

Move the highlight to the menu option you want to execute.  To move the
highlight, use the cursor motion keys, or press the letter of the
desired option.  Press Enter once the desired selection is highlighted.

[Option overviews:]

PROMPT         {Provides an interactive report generation method. 
               General prompts the user through the creation of a
               report.}

STACK          {Provides access to previously executed report commands,
               so that they may be re-executed, edited, or stored for
               permanent access by the RUN command.  The command history
               stack holds the last 18 report commands issued.}
.page
[Option overviews, continued:]

RUN            {Used to re-execute or maintain previously stored report
               commands.}

LIST           {Enters LIST command mode.  LIST is General's english-
               like report writing language.}

QUIT           {Exits General, returning to your application or to the
               operating system.}
.page
If you are an administrative user, you also have the following options:

DICTIONARY     {Provides access to General's data dictionary maintance
               module.  Dictionary maintenance involves associating a
               file name with a disk file, defining fields and
               calculations, links to other files, and pre-structured
               sort files or alternate keys General can use.}

CONFIG         {Used to maintain General configuration elements,
               including display options, terminal options, printer
               drivers, and user-defined functions and variables.}
\\GEN4-KWP\PROMPT TEXT
Enter the text General should present to the user when prompting for
this value.
\\GEN4-KWP\PROMPT TYPE
Enter the data type General should prompt for.

T    {Text data, such as code numbers or key ranges.}
Nd   {Numeric data, of decimal precision d.}
D    {Date data, internally converted to a julian number.}
\\GEN4-KWP\PROMPT DEFAULT
Enter a default value for the prompt.  This will be what General
presents to the user as a suggested value when the prompt is issued.
\\GEN4-KWP\CALC NAME
Enter a name to identify this calculation.  The name can include
letters, numbers, and single underscores.  If you need to refer to this
calculation later in the LIST command, you can simply call it by its
name.
\\GEN4-KWP\TAB POS
Enter the column and row position of the next field or literal element,
in the format:

          col       column position in current row
          col.row   column and row position
\GEN4-KWP\SPACES
Enter the number of spaces to put between the prior field or literal and
the next field or literal.  General defaults to one space.
\\GEN4-KWP\WIDTH
Enter the number of columns for the report.  If a printer is designated,
it must be capable of printing this many columns.
\\GEN4-KWP\LINES
Enter the number of printed lines per page.  Note that this is NOT the
total number of lines on a page.  When entering a number here, be sure
to allow for top and bottom margins.
\\GEN4-KWP\LBREAK
Enter the number of lines between groupings.  General will place a blank
line on the report each time this many lines have been printed.
\\GEN4-KWP\ALTFILE
Enter the name of the file to use as an alternate sort to the primary
file.  If you aren't sure of the name, use the List Files key.
\\GEN4-KWP\ALTFILE KEY
Enter an expression to be used by General to derive the primary file's
key from the alternate file's key.  The expression should use the dummy
variable K$ to represent the alternate file key.  For example, derive a
primary file's key from two segments and a literal, the entry might look
like this: [K$(1,2)+K$(23,5)+"A00"].
\\GEN4-KWP\KEY NUMBER
Select the key chain number to use from this list.  The primary file in
the LIST command will be processed using this key, which can be used to
derive a sorting order and/or a key range.
\\GEN4-KWP\EXPORT TYPE
Choose the export type from this list.  Spreadsheets typically can
import a delimited or DIF format, word processors a fixed format. 
WordPerfect merge is specifically used to generate a file to be used a a
secondary merge file in a WordPerfect merge operation.
\\GEN4-KWP\DELIMITER
Enter a delimiter to be used in a delimited export format.  Normally
this will be a comma, but you can specify any value here.  If you need
to enter a non-printable value, such as a tab character, enter it in
General ASCII notation (\~009, for a tab character).
\\GEN4-KWP\LINK FROM
Enter the file name from.  This defaults to the name of the primary file
for the LIST command.  Link definitions placed on the command line
override and/or add to those placed in the dictionary, so that any field
references later in the LIST command can utilize this link.

If you are unsure of the file name, press the List Files key.
\\GEN4-KWP\LINK TO
Enter the name of the "link to" file.  This is the target file of the
link definition.  If you are unsure of the file name, use the List Files
key.  If this link uses an alternate sort definition, enter the file, an
"@" symbol, and the sort name.
\\GEN4-KWP\LINK FULL/PART
Enter the type of link this is.  A "full" type uses the full key to
access a record in the target file.  A "part" link uses the key as a
partial key, and scans all records in the target file which start with
the key value specified.
\\GEN4-KWP\LINK KEY
Enter the expression used to generate the key or partial key for this
link.  The expression can contain fields from the "from file"
dictionary, physical field and record references in the form of @PFn or
@REC, intrinsic and General functions, and literals.  For example:

     CUST_NO+INVOICE_NO
     FIRM+"A  "+TERMS_CODE
     "A"+CHR(2)+LEFT(CODE,5)
\\GEN4-KWP\ALTSORT
Choose the alternate sort desired from this list.  The primary file will
be processed in the order defined by the sort definition in the
dictionary, and any BEGIN or END key range specifiers apply to this
definition also.
\\GEN4-KWP\PREFIX
Enter a value for General to place before each record in an export.  If,
for example, an export needs to start with an asterisk, enter "*" here. 
If a non-printable character is required, use General's ASCII notation,
such as \~009 for a tab character.
\\GEN4-KWP\SUFFIX
Enter a value for General to place after each record in an export.  If,
for example, an export needs to end each line with "<EOR>", enter that
character string here.  If a non-printable character is required, use
General's ASCII notation, such as \~009 for a tab character.
\\GEN4-KWP\BEGIN
Enter a value used to indicate a starting point for the report.  The
starting point relates to either the primary key to the LIST file, or if
an ALTKEY, ALTFILE, or ALTSORT keyword is used, the starting point
applies to the sort generated by that keyword.  BEGIN is often used in
conjunction with the END keyword to define a report range.
\\GEN4-KWP\END
Enter a value to indicate the ending point for a report.  The ending
point relates to either the primary key of the LIST file, or to an
ALTKEY, ALTFILE, or ALTSORT keyword, if one is used.  When used in
conjunction with the BEGIN keyword, a report range can be defined.
\\GEN4-KWP\HEADERN
Enter the break level number to associate the header sub-phrase with.  A
level of 0 indicates the report page header.
\\GEN4-KWP\FOOTERN
Enter the break level number to associate the footer sub-phrase with.  A
level of 0 indicates the report footer.
\\GEN4-KWP\NOT MKEYED
The primary file for this report isn't a multi-keyed file, so no ALTKEY
definitions exist.
\\GEN4-KWP\ACROSS
Enter the number of records to print across each report line. 
Typically, this is used when printing labels, but any report can be
printed in this fashion.

GENERAL calculates the total report line length by multiplying the WIDTH
times the ACROSS values, so it is important to also specify a shortened
WIDTH value when ACROSS is used.
\\GEN4-KWP\TESTPRINT
Enter the number of records to print as test patterns before the first
data record is printed.  The test pattern will consist of a format
matching the first record printed, filled with asterisks.  This is
useful when printing on labels or pre-printed forms.
\\GEN4-KWP\HEIGHT
Enter a fixed hight, in lines, for each record to occupy.  This setting
can be used to fix the number of rows on a label report, even if the NO-
BLANK keyword is used to suppress blank lines.  Note that if data is
positioned on lines below this value, it will not print.
\\GEN4-HLP\MORE HELP
Select the option desired:

Page           {Display the next page (same as page down)}
Keyboard       {Display keyboard usage}
More Topics    {Select generic help topics}
Done           {Exit help system}
\\SYSTEM\KEYS
Presented below is a table of standard and alternate keystrokes.  The
alternate keystrokes shown are the control-key defaults provided by
Filix.  Your alternate keystrokes may differ, as they may be loaded from
an alternate key map file with the "-k" command line switch.  To see
what those keystrokes are, print out that file.

is supplied from outside of General, then enter the login name here so
that an access level and optional password can be defined for the user.

User codes can be up to 20 characters long, without spaces.  Any
characters are valid.

If you are unsure of a code, press the List key to select from a list of
existing General user login codes.
\\GEN4USER\NAME
Enter the name of the user associated with this user login code.  This
information is used when presenting user lists for the code entry above.
\\GEN4USER\ACL
Enter this user's access level.  An access level is a number between 0
and 9.  Higher access levels allow greater access to files defined in
General's dictionary.  In order to produce a report from a file, a
user's access level must be at least as high as that defined for the
file.

Level 9 users are considered "administrative" users.  These users have
access to the dictionary, configuration, and user definition programs
within General, and also have access to all files when running reports.
\\GEN4USER\PASSWORD
Enter a password for this user code.  The password will be required at
login time, if entered here.

Passwords are optional, and are encrypted, so General has no way of
knowing what the last password was.  If a user needs to retain their
same password, press the Exit key here.  Anything entered here, if
followed by a <Enter> key, will create a new password for the user.

To not require a password for this user, this entry should be blank.
\\GEN4USER\NEW ENTRY
Verify that this is a new user login code.
\\GEN4USER\VERIFY
Yes       {File the information as displayed.}

No        {Change the information.}

Delete    {Delete this user login code.}

Pressing the Exit key will abort this definition without filing it.
\\GEN4-DMP\RECORD
[To paste a data element to the expression:]

Move the cursor to the physical field element desired.  Press <Enter> to
paste just "@PFn" or @REC to the expression.  If you want to paste a
sub-string of the data, use the F3-mark substring key to view the full
field, in ASCII and hexadecimal, for marking of a sub-string.

[To move to another record:]  Press the F2-next record key.  General
will prompt you for a new record key, or a motion option to move through
the file.

[To see fields] that reference this and other physical fields, press the
F4-fields key.
\\GEN4-DMP\NEXT KEY
Choose the key of the next record to view.  You can enter a key
directly, or press a cursor key:

Up        {Move to the previous record}
Down/F2   {Move to the next record}
Home      {Move to the first record}
End       {Move to the last record}
\\GEN4-DMP\FIELD
Use the cursor motion keys to view additional portions of the record,
and to move the cursor to the starting point of a sub-string.  To anchor
the substring, press the F2-set anchor key.  Furthur cursor motion will
display the positioning of the sub-string.

When the correct sub-string is identified by the anchor point and the
current cursor position, press <Enter> to paste the data reference into
the expression.

To view the dictionary elements that have been defined for this and
other physical fields, press the F4-fields key.
\\GEN4INT1\REPORT NAME
Enter the name for the report.  This name is used to identify the report
definition, so that it can be later accessed and modified.  If you
aren't sure of the name, use the F2-list reports key to choose from a
list.

To return to the main menu, press the F10-exit key.
\\GEN4INT1\TITLE
Enter a report title.  To split the title on multiple lines at report
time, use vertical bars, such as "REPORT TITLE|COMPANY X".  This title
also becomes the description of the report design, and is used in
selection lists when displayed.
\\GEN4INT1\FILE NAME
Enter the name of the file to be used to generate the report.  The file
must have a dictionary specified, or be defined in a supported external
dictionary.  To choose a file from a selection list, press the F2-list
files key, or enter a wildcard instead of a valid name.
\\GEN4INT1\REPORT TYPE
Enter the type code for this report.  This code determines how GENERAL
will format the report at run-time.

1    {Tabular (row and column) report}
2    {Delimited ASCII export}
3    {Fixed position ASCII export}
4    {DIF export}
5    {WordPerfect merge}
6    {Gateway for Windows}
\\GEN4INT1\GATEWAY TYPE
Choose the Gateway for Windows format.  Choose the target application
that is running on your workstation.
\\GEN4INT1\WIDTH
Enter the width for the report, in columns.  GENERAL will only allow
this report to be printed on devices capable of supporting this width. 
Normally, this will be 80 or 132, but it can be any number from 30 to
255.
\\GEN4INT1\LENGTH
Enter the number of printed lines per page, making an allowance for 
top and bottom margins.  Normally, GENERAL will calculate this value
automatically, based on the printer device.  If this entry is left blank,
then the report will be based on that calculated value.

It may sometimes be necessary to override this number, however, such
as when a PREVIEW device is chosen, and the default 66-line page is wrong.
\\GEN4INT1\HEIGHT
If the report requires that each record occupy a fixed number of rows
(labels, for example), then enter that number of rows here.  GENERAL
will force output to this height even of the Print Blanks is set to No.

Normally, the number of rows required is calculated from the data
printed and the Double Space setting.  Note that entering a height
parameter will truncate any data printing below the specified lines.
\\GEN4INT1\ACROSS
Enter the number of records to print across a line.  Normally, this
would be 1, but in some cases (particularly mailing labels), it is
desirable to print more than one record across the page.  This number
may be any value from 1 to 9.
\\GEN4INT1\OUTPUT
Enter the name of the regular printer to be used for this report, or
leave this blank to print to the video.  If desired, two special printer
names are offered: 

     PRINTER   will prompt at run-time for a printer, video, or file.

     FILE      will prompt at run-time for a file name.

     PREVIEW   will print to a file, display the report, and allow a
               hardcopy option from that point.

You may also enter a path name here that will be used as an output file
for the report every time it is printed.  If the path name doesn't
contain slashes, it must be enclosed in quotes (if it does contain
slashes, GENERAL will quote it automatically).
\\GEN4INT1\TESTRECS
Enter the number of test records to print before actual data begins
printing.  The test records are formed by making an image of the first
record printed, and printing it this many times, before continuing with
the report.  This can be very useful when running labels or pre-printed
forms with GENERAL.

To have General prompt after each row of test records has printed, allowing
for more test records or for the report to start, then enter -1.
\\GEN4INT1\ALTSORT
If the file selected for this report has alternate sorts defined, then
you can select one of those here.  When the report is executed, the
records will be processed in the order defined by the alternate sort
selected.

When an alternate sort is selected, the "Start with:" and "End with:"
fields apply to the alternate sort order.

You can also define sorting for a report with the Sort option, available
from the report verification prompt.
\\GEN4INT1\START WITH
Enter the beginning point to start the report, based on either the
default sort order for the file selected, or the alternate sort, if
selected.  If this is left blank, the report will begin with the first
record on file.
\\GEN4INT1\END WITH
Enter the ending point to stop the report, based on either the default
sort order for the file selected, or the alternate sort, if selected. 
If this is left blank, the report will end at the end of the file.
\\GEN4INT1\LINE BREAK
If you want the report to skip a line every n-th line, enter the number
of lines to print before each skip.
\\GEN4INT1\STOP
If you want the report to stop printing after a certain number records
have been output, enter the number of records.
\\GEN4INT1\DOUBLE SPACE
To double space the report, choose Yes.  A blank line will be printed
between each record.
\\GEN4INT1\VERT TOTAL
Set this item to Yes to force sub-totals and grand-totals to print in
table fashion, instead of below the columns.  Any customized footers
will override this setting.  Note that in cases where column formatting
is impossible, GENERAL will automatically switch to vertical formatting.
\\GEN4INT1\BLANK LINES
Choose No to suppress the printing of blank lines on the report, except
for double-space lines.
\\GEN4INT1\PAGINATE
Choose No to suppress page formatting, with page ejects and page
headers.  This is common when sending the report to a file for inclusion
in another application.
\\GEN4INT1\RECAP
Choose No to suppress printing of the recap page at the end of the
report.
\\GEN4INT1\DETAIL
Choose No to suppress printing of detail records, forcing a "totals-
only" report instead.
\\GEN4INT1\HEADING
Choose No to suppress printing of column headings in a default page
header.  The title portion of the header still prints.
\\GEN4INT1\TABULATE
Choose Yes to force a cross-tabulation or summary report, rather than
a normal columnar report.  Cross-tabulation reports create a summary
table display based on one or two break points, and column calculations.

A summary table uses one break point, and up to six column calculations;
a cross tabulation uses two break points and one column calculation.  See
PLOT in the manual for more detail.
\\GEN4INT1\COPIES
Enter the number of copies of this report to print.  The default is 1,
and any higher value will print that many copies of any report sent to
a file or printer.  Multiple copies are ignored for reports sent to the
video or PREVIEW device.
\\GEN4INT1\OPTION
Select the option desired.  The options do the following:

Yes       {Files the report definition header, as displayed.}
No        {Maintains the header elements.}
Field     {Opens the field definition window for the report definition.}
Break     {Opens the break point specification window.}
Sort      {Opens the sort specification window.}
Criteria  {Opens the record selection criteria specification window.}
Hdr/Ftr   {Allows maintenance of customized headers and footers.}
Run       {Runs the report.}
Delete    {Removes this report definition, after verification.}
Print     {Prints a hardcopy of the report definition.}
.page
The various specification windows are used to maintain different aspects
of the report.

The field portion is used to specify what data fields or calculations
are to be placed on the report, their positions, and any column
calculations or format specifications.

The break portion is used to specify field on which to force sub-total
break points.

The sort section is used to specify a sort order, based on one or more
fields or calculations, if the default order for the file isn't what is
desired.
.page
[Specifications, continued]

The criteria section is used to specify selection criteria that each
record must pass before inclusion on the report.

The header/footer section allows "painting" of custom headers and
footers for the report and for each break level.  Normally, default
footers and a default page header are provided automatically.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD NAME
Enter the name of the field you want to place on the report.  To choose
the field from a list of fields in the dictionary, press the F2-list
fields key.

If you want to define a calculation, press the F6-calc key.  GENERAL
will issue the prompts to define the calculation.

If you want to specify a field in a related (linked) file, press the F5-
link key.  GENERAL will prompt for the related file and field to produce
the link.

If you want to specify a literal text element, press the F7-text key.

F3-insert inserts a blank line.
F4-delete deletes the current line, after verification.
F9- or F10-done exits the definition window.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD COLUMN
Enter the column, if you want to specify an exact placement, or press
<Enter> to let GENERAL calculate positions for you automatically.  If
you just press <Enter>, then future insertions will update the position
of this field, avoiding any positioning conflicts.  If GENERAL
calculates the positions, then the field is called a "floating" field.

If the column position has been previously fixed, press the F2-float key
to return it to a floating position.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD ROW
Enter the row, if you want to specify exact placement, or press <Enter>
to let GENERAL calculate the position automatically.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD CASE
For text fields, you can specify that GENERAL should perform a case
conversion at report time.

1    {No conversion takes place (data is printed as stored).}
2    {Convert text to upper case.}
3    {Convert text to lower case.}
4    {Convert text to proper case (initial caps).}
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD NO DUP
If the value of this field will be duplicated going down the column, for
example, a customer name being repeated for many invoices, then the
duplicate values can be suppressed by choosing 2 - suppress.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD TOTAL
Enter 2 to produce a column total calculation on this field.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD AVERAGE
Enter 2 to produce a column average calculation on this field.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD MAX
Enter 2 to produce a column maximum calculation on this field.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD MIN
Enter 2 to produce a column minimum calculation on this field.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD PCT
Enter 2 to produce a percent-of-total calculation on this field.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD COUNT
Enter 2 to produce a record count calculation on this field.
\\GEN4INT2\FIELD DTF
Choose a date qualifier, or leave blank to print the full date.  The
date qualifier adjusts the date format to print just the month and year
or just the year.  Here are format examples for a date of January 2,
1993:

Blank (0) {01/02/1992  (based on system date format definition)}
1         {Jan/1992}
2         {01/1992}
3         {01/92}
4         {Jan/92}
5         {1992}
6         {1992/01}
7         {92/01}
\\GEN4INT2\VERIFY FIELD
Verify that the field specification is correct.

Yes       {File the information as displayed.}
No        {Maintain the specification.}
Visual    {Enter the screen painter mode to maintain the report data.}
\\GEN4INT2\VISUAL
The "visual mode" for data specification is a simple screen painter,
which allows you to move around the screen, typing text, moving fields,
and defining or modifying data specifications.

To enter fixed text to place within the data portion of a report, simply
type it at the column and row you want.

To place a data field on the report, move to the position you want it,
and press the F2-data key.  A data specification window will be opened
for detail to be filled in.  Likewise, to modify an existing data field
specification, place the cursor on the field and press the F2-data key.

Data positions can be identified by the digit-letter code, followed by
tildes to fill out the length of the field.
.page
[More on visual options:]

To move a data field or any other "word", move the cursor to the field
and press the F3-move key.  The field will be "blanked out" with plus
signs (+), and the "move-to" option will be presented.  Move the cursor
to the new point and press the F3-move to key.

To delete a data field, use the F2-data key, and choose the Delete
option from the data definition window.  This is preferred over simply
deleting the text from the screen painter.
\\GEN4INT2\VISUAL MOVE
Press F3-move to to update the placement of the field being moved.
\\GEN4INT2\DATA WINDOW CORRECT
Verify that the data definition is correct.

Yes       {Saves the data field as displayed.}
No        {Maintain the specification.}
Delete    {Delete the field from the data specification.}
\\GEN4INT2\VISUAL CORRECT
Verify that the visual image of the report line is correct.

Yes       {Saves the specification as shown.  Any field postions become
          fixed, and the specification table is updated and re-
          displayed.}

No        {Re-enter screen painting.}

Press F10-exit to restore the original data specification, of changes
made in the screen painter mode should be discarded.
\\GEN4INT2\LINK ID
Enter the name by which this link will be identified.  The name can be
from 1 to 14 letters or digits, and can contain underscores, if desired.

"@LINK" will be added automatically to the name.
\\GEN4INT2\LINK FILE
Choose the file from which to get the link data field.
\\GEN4-LFD\FIELD
Use the cursor keys to choose the field desired.  You can also select
fields by the first letter of their name.

Pressing F2-list toggle will switch the list format to a wide screen,
name-only list that displays up to 45 fields per page.
\\GEN4INT1\BREAK ITEM
Enter the name of the data field to base this break level on.  If a
calculation is required, it must be defined in the data specification
section, and can be referenced by name here.

F3-insert will insert a blank line in the table.
F4-delete will delete the current line from the table.
F9- or F10-done will exit maintenance.
\\GEN4INT2\TEXT ID
Enter the name of the text element.  Names can be from 1 to 14 letters
or digits, and can contain underscores.  "@TEXT" is automatically added
to the name by GENERAL.
\\GEN4INT2\TEXT
Enter the literal text you want placed on the report.
\\GEN4INT1\BREAK SPECIAL
Enter special break control information, if desired.

For text fields, enter the number of characters to base the break on, if
not the full field.

For numeric fields, enter an "even" break amount to base the break on,
such as 10000 to break on even increments of 10,000.

For date fields, choose the format specifier option from the display.
\\GEN4INT1\BREAK TYPE
Choose the type of break to perform:

1    {Line break, which skips a line before the next group.}
2    {Page break, which starts the next group on the next page.}
\\GEN4INT1\BREAK CORRECT
Verify that the break specification is correct.
\\GEN4INT1\SORT ITEM
Enter the name of the data field to base this sort level on.  If a
calculation is required, it must be defined in the data specification
section, and can be referenced by name here.

To choose the field from a selection list, press F2-list fields.


F3-insert will insert a blank line in the table.
F4-delete will delete the current line from the table.
F9- or F10-done will exit maintenance.
\\GEN4INT1\SORT ORDER
Enter the ordering choice for this segment of the sort specification.

1    {Ascending order}
2    {Descending order}
\\GEN4INT1\SORT CORRECT
Verify that the sort specification is correct.
\\GEN4INT3\VERIFY
Verify that the criteria specification is correct.
\\GEN4INT3\FIELD NAME
Enter the name of a field on which to base selection criteria.  The
name, combined with an operator and a comparison expression, make up a
"relational expression", which is tested at report time as each record
is processed.  If a calculation is required, it must be defined in the
Data specification, and can be referenced by name here.

To choose the field from a selection list, press the F2-list fields key.

F3-insert will insert a blank line in the table.

F4-delete will delete the current line from the table.

Each individual selection criteria can be connected to the next by AND
or OR connectors, in order to apply multiple criteria to the selection
of records.  In addition, groups of expressions can be linked together,
and connected to other groups by "group AND" or "group OR" connectors. 
To place a group connector, press F5-group AND or F6-group OR.

F9- or F10-done will exit maintenance.
\\GEN4INT3\OPERATOR
Enter the relational operator to use when comparing the name defined on
the left with the name or expression entered on the right.  The
operators allowed are:

     =    equal to
     >    greater than
     >=   greater than or equal to
     <    less than
     <=   less than or equal to
     <>   not equal to
.page
[Relational operators, continued:]

For text fields, four additional operators can be used:

     ==   contains (the right side exists in the left side)
     +=   contains at position 1
     -=   does not contain
     \~=  matches the regular expression on the right (may be a wildcard
          on some implementations, rather than a regular expression).

To choose from a list of valid operators, press F2-list operators.
\\GEN4INT3\COMPARE TO
Enter a field, literal, or simple expression to compare the field to.  

To choose a field from a selection list, press the F2-list fields key.

Simple expressions, containing fields, constants, and arithmatic
operators +,-,*,/, and ^ are supported.  The operators perform addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, respectively. 
Note that expressions are NOT tested for syntax errors at entry time.

Use \[\[prompt-text\]\] to have GENERAL issue a run-time prompt.  If the
prompt text is enclosed in quotes, a data type can also be included. 
See More topics for more information about run-time replacements.
.page
When comparing a text field to an unquoted literal value, GENERAL will
add quotes automatically.  However, if the value is the same as a field
name, or it contains a "+", GENERAL will not assume that it must be
quoted, and it will have to be manually quoted.

When comparing a date field to a literal date, you should use either the
CND keyword with a date in quoted 6- or 8-digit date entry format, or
use a quoted, delimited date value.  In either case, the order of the
month, day, and year depends on the system configuration for the date
entry convention.
\\GEN4INT3\CONNECTOR
Choose the connector, if required, to connect this expression with the
next.  If you don't select a connector, but one is required due to
another expression following this one, GENERAL will default to OR.

1    {AND connector, meaning that both this line and the next line must
     be true for the record to be printed.}

2    {OR connector, meaning that either this line or the next line may
     be true for the record to be printed.}
\\GEN4INT4\SELECT HDR/FTR
Choose the header or footer to customize.  The report level header and
footer refer to the page header and report footer, respectively.  Each
break level also provides a header and footer specification.

GENERAL will provide a default page header and default break-level and
report footers automatically.  Only customized headers or footers should
be defined here.
\\GEN4INT4\VISUAL
Enter the header or footer text, where desired.  Several special text
elements can be added that will be replaced by values at report time:

     @DATE, @DTM, @TIME will be replaced by the date, the date and time,
     or the time, respectively.

     @USER, @TTY, @VDT will be replaced by the user login name, the
     terminal device name, or the terminal alias, respectively.

     @PAGE, @PAGEDSC will be replaced by the page number or "Page #",
     respectively.

In addition, you can place report data elements or calculations on the
header or footer, by pressing the F2-data key.  The calculations can
include functions, such as RSUM() or GSUM() to calculate report- or
group-summary totals and place them in the header or footer.
.page
[Header/Footer paint options, continued:]

To move any element, press the F3-move key.  The element will be
highlighted and the cursor can be moved to the new position, and the F3-
move to key pressed to place the data or word in the new position.

To copy the header or footer from defaults, press the F5-copy from
default key.  GENERAL will place the standard header or footer, complete
with any sub-total calculations, in the screen painter.  It can then be
further modified, as desired.  Optionally, to set a header back to
defaults, you can delete all the text.  Blank definitions are set to
default values by GENERAL at run-time.

To force a blank line to appear in a header or footer, place a period
(.) or the word @LINE by itself on the line, at the left margin.
.page
[Header/Footer paint options, continued:]

To restore a custom header to the default, so that GENERAL will print
a standard header or footer, simply delete all the text in the custom
header or footer design.  This is most easily accomplished by using the
"delete line" key (usually control-D) until all the text is gone.
\\GEN4INT4\VERIFY
Verify that the above header or footer image is correct.
\\GEN4INT4\VISUAL MOVE
Move the cursor to the point desired, and press F3-move to.  The field
or word selected will be moved to the new position.
\\GEN4INT4\TYPE CODES
Enter the type codes to specify the data to be placed in the header or
footer.  Type codes are made up of a base type and a length, plus
optional, comma separated codes to control additional formatting.

     T,L20     indicates a 20-character text field.
     N,L14     indicates a 14-character numeric field.
     D,L10     indicates a 10-character date field.
.page
Other formatting codes allowed are described below:

Text fields:   n         The number of lines to allocate, if over 1.
               JL,JR     Left or right justification

Numeric:       n         Decimal precision
               JL,JR     Left or right justification
               P         Punctuate (thousands separators)
               -,CR,()   Negative indicators

Date:          T         Time printed with date
               JL,JR     Left or right justification
\\GEN4INT4\TYPE EXPRESSION
Enter the calculation expression or field name to place in the header or
footer.  Calculations can include fields, literal values, and group
summary or report summary functions.

For example, a numeric calculation might be 100*DIVIDE( GSUM(YTD.SLS,1),
RSUM(YTD.SLS) ) to calculate a percent-of-total of the group total, at
break level 1, of the YTD.SLS field.

@BREAKn will place the value of the break point for the specified level
in a text field.
\\GEN4INT4\DATA WINDOW CORRECT
Verify that the data specification is correct.

Yes       {Saves the data specification.}
No        {Maintains the specificition.}
Delete    {Removes the data from the header or footer.}
\\GEN4INT6\FILE NAME
Enter the file name on which to impose detail selection criteria.  Detail
criteria applies to files linked to the primary file for this report that
supply multiple records for each primary file record (a one-to-many 
relationship, or 'partial key', relationship).  These detail records
cannot be referenced in the standard Criteria window logic, but can be
referenced here.

To see a list of known linked files, use the 'linked files' list.  To 
see a complete list of all files, use the 'all files' list, or enter a
wildcard (such as AR*) to see a limited list of all files.

For more information, see the 4.1 supplement guide.
\\GEN4INT6\NO DETAIL LINK
No links (of one-to-many type) were found in the dictionary.
\\GEN4INT6\CRITERIA
Enter the selection criteria to impose on records coming from the file
specified for this entry.  This criteria should take the form of an
IF expression fragment, such as AMOUNT > 0, or DATE < @DATE - 30.  When
the report is executed, a SELECT FROM <file> <criteria> will be added to
the report command.

Note that to impose criteria on records coming from the primary file
for this report, or from any file that is in a one-to-one relation
to the primary file, you should use the Criteria window rather than
this one.
\\GEN4INT6\INVALID SYNTAX
The criteria entered is invalid for this file.
\\GEN4INT6\VERIFY
Verify that the detail criteria shown is valid.

Yes indicates it is correct.
No allows you to make changes.
Exiting with F10 (or Escape-0) will discard any changes made.
\\GEN4INT6\DELETE CRITERIA
Are you sure you want to delete this line in the window?
\\GEN4INT6\ABORT?
Changes have been made to the information shown.  Are you sure you want
to lose them?
\\GEN4-PRP\PRINTER
Enter the printer to print the report design hardcopy to.  Press F2-list
printers to choose the printer from a selection list.
\\GENV4\Data Type Codes
Type codes define for General what type of data a field or calculation
contains, and also how to present that data on reports.

The basic type codes are T, N, and D, which indicate text, numeric, and
date data, respectively.  Following that there must be a length code,
Ln, where n is the number of columns this field will occupy on a report. 

T,L25 would define a text field of 25 columns.
N,L12 would define a numeric field of 12 columns.
D,L10 would define a date field of 10 columns.

Additional parameters are separated by spaces, and are dependent on the
base field type.  More detail follows.

[Text type codes]

JR or JL       Forces right or left justication.  Normally, General will
               left justify, but will not trim any leading spaces from
               the data.

n              The field will occupy n lines.  This allows the splitting
               of long data across several lines.

Additional type codes can be added to the base type and length type
codes by separating each with a comma.  For example, T,L30,3,G2 would
define a 30 column by 3 line (90 characters total), assigned to prompt
group 2.
.page
[Numeric type codes]

JL or JR       Forces left or right justification.  Normally numeric
               fields are right justified.

n              Print field with n decimal precision.

P              Print the field punctuated (with thousands separators).

-,CR,(), or $  Use trailing minus sign, trailing CR, or enclosing
               parenthesis for negative numbers, or use currency
               formatting as defined in the system configuration.  The
               default is a leading minus sign.

Sn             Scale the number by a factor of n.  Scaling is used for
               data containing an implied decimal.
.page
[Date type codes]

JR or JL       Force left or right justification of the data.

T              This is a date and time field, where time is stored in
               the data as a fraction of a day.
\\GENV4\New Since Version 3
Version 4 of General provides many substantial enhancements over Version
3 and 3X.n releases.  There are also some changes in commonly used
syntax, which the user needs to be aware of.

Run-time Replacements         {Run-time replacements in Version 3 were
                              delimited by single square brackets.  In
                              Version 4, they are delimited by double
                              square brackets.

                              \[Enter a value\] becomes
                              \[\[Enter a value\]\].  There are also
                              additional enhancements allowing type
                              definition and default values available.}

[Version 4 changes, continued]

LIST command execution        {Version 3 allowed typing/editing of a
                              command up until a <Enter> key was
                              pressed.  Version 4 is more flexible in
                              command editing, allowing you to move up
                              and down though a scrolling command entry
                              screen.  The <Enter> key is used to move
                              to the next line.  To begin execution of
                              the command, press the Execute key.}

Menu access                   {Version 3 allowed command mode [or] menu
                              mode.  To move from command mode to the
                              menu, a MENU command was issued.  Version
                              4 [always] provides a menu, which has an
                              option to enter command mode.  When
                              exiting command mode, the menu returns.}

Dictionary                    {The former FILE, FIELD, and DUMP commands
                              have been consolidated into the DICTIONARY
                              module.  File headers are defined first,
                              followed by subsidiary information such as
                              field definitions, sorts, and external
                              file relations (links).

                              Fields are now defined using data type
                              codes (T=text, N=number, D=date) and
                              optional parameters, a heading, and an
                              expression.}

[Version 4 changes, continued]

Command line calculations     {Version 4 allows for the definition of
                              calculations on the command line.  The
                              basic syntax follows that of field
                              definitions in the dictionary, within the
                              context of a parenthesized function.

                              TRIM(CITY)+", "+STATE+"  "+ZIP) would
                              define a 40 character text field, column
                              heading "CITY, STATE ZIP", and provide the
                              expression to perform.}

Assist mode                   {When in command entry, a new Assist mode
                              is provided which presents a point-and-
                              shoot approach to creating a report. 
                              Assist supports file linkages, provides
                              prompts when required for keyword
                              parameters, and allows direct entry when
                              desired.  There is also a good deal of on-
                              line help for keyword topics while in
                              Assist.}

Prompt mode                   {Prompt mode has been greatly enhanced to

                              features, and to provide users with two
                              often requested interfaces: table-driven
                              and visual.  The table interface allows
                              users to simply fill out a table of
                              information to produce the report.  The
                              visual interface allows a report to be
                              "painted" on screen.  Both modes can be
                              toggled, so the user can move freely from
                              one mode to the other.}
\\GENV4\Calculation Expressions
Expressions are used in fields and calculations to instruct GENERAL how
to calculate a value.  Expressions can be a simple as a physical field
reference or can include multiple statements with embedded Basic and
General functions, IF .. THEN .. ELSE logic, and so on.

[Data references]
Data can be referenced in the expression in four ways: 

                              as a physical field (from 1 to 255) by
                              using the name @PFn, where n is the
                              physical field number,

                              as a data record, using the name @REC,

                              as the primary key, using the name @KEY,

                              or as another field in this file, by using
                              its name.
.page
[Syntax examples]

@PF3                          {simple field reference, text or implied
                              numeric}

&DATE_CONVERT(MID(@PF3,7,6))  {user defined function, MID function}

NUM(@PF4)+NUM(@PF5)+NUM(@PF6) {combined numeric fields}

@REC(11,30)                   {record substring reference}

                              references}
.page
[Functions]

General allows the use of both intrinsic Basic functions as well as
several pre-defined functions that perform more complex precedures and
return value.  Nearly all Basic functions can be entered in the
expression just as in standard Basic syntax.  General functions include:

                              &x(), &x$(), user-defined function named x
                              @BREAKn, the break value for break level n

.page
[Conditional Logic]

Normally, an expression will simply represent a fragment of a full Basic
LET statement, but if the expression begins with IF, then it is treated
as a complete statement.  Conditional expressions must take the form of:

IF relational-expression THEN assignment

                      or

IF expression THEN assignment-1 ELSE assignment-2

Examples:

IF CODE>"" THEN @FLD=EXPAND(CODE,"Y,N","YES,NO") ELSE @FLD="NEITHER"
.page
[Compound expressions]

Multiple statements may be separated by semi-colons, in which case
General will execute each statement in turn.  This execution is not
based on a prior condition, as in standard Basic syntax.  If such
compound expressions need to be logically grouped together, then the
group operators \{\} can be used.

A simple compound expression example:
NUM(@PF2)*100; IF @FLD<0 THEN @FLD=ABS(@FLD)

An example of group operator usage:
IF @REC(1,2)="99" THEN \{ YTD.SLS=0; YTD.COST=0 \}; 
@FLD=YTD.SLS-YTD.COST
\\GEN4DICT\DUPLICATE LINK
Only one link definition per target file name is valid.  If there are
multiple links possible to the same physical disk file, that file should
probably have multiple GENERAL file definitions.
\\GEN4TEMP\CONTINUE
Choose the desired report continuation option:

Y    {Continue to the next page, or exit the report if at the end.}
N    {Exit the report.}

Pressing the F10-exit key will also exit the report immediately.

If the video report is being buffered, which will normally be the case,
then several other options are available from function keys, described
on the next page.
.page
[Video display options:]

F2   {Displays the the first page of the report.}

F3   {Displays the last page (buffering to the last page may take a
     while, and can be interrupted with the <Interrupt> key).}

F4   {Prompts for search text, then begins searching for a page
     containing that text.  The search begins on the next page, and can
     be interrupted witn the <Interrupt> key.}
\\GENV4\Printing Labels
[Printing Mailing Labels with GENERAL]

GENERAL provides several keywords that can assist in the production of
labels from a file.  The dimensions for the labels can be specified with
the following keywords:

     WIDTH     Specifies the number of characters per label.
     HEIGHT    Specifies the number of rows per label.
     ACROSS    Specifies the number of labels per line.

To print 3-up labels, for example, a LIST command could contain the
keywords {WIDTH 35 HEIGHT 6 ACROSS 3}.
.page
[Field placement on labels:]

Use the TAB keyword to place fields on the label at any point desired,
using substringing if required to truncate any field longer than the
label width:

     {TAB 2.2 NAME TAB 2.3 ADDR1 TAB 2.4 ADDR2 TAB 2.5
     CITY_ST_ZIP(1,30)}
.page
[Controlling overall page format:]

Labels normally are continuous, so that no page ejects or headers are
desired.  GENERAL makes this "non-formatting" easy.  Just include the
NO-PAGE keyword and all such formatting is suppressed.

If the labels are to be printed on a laser printer, page formatting is
trickier.  On a laser printer, page ejects may be necessary, so the NO-
PAGE keyword shouldn't be used.  Instead, use the HEADER0 keyword to
specify the correct number of blank lines at the top of each label
sheet, and the LENGTH keyword to specify the total number of lines to
print per page (overriding any default margins GENERAL uses).

{LIST ... HEADER0 TAB 1.2 "" OFF LENGTH 64}, for example, would indicate
a blank 2-line heading, and 64 lines per page (including the 2 line
heading).

Edit      {Edit the LIST command that the report produces, before
          executing the report.  Editing the LIST command will not
          modify the report definition.  The effect will only be for
          this execution of the report.}

Save      {The LIST command (edited, if the Edit option has been used),
          is saved as a RUN command.  GENERAL will prompt for a name,
          description, and security option.}
