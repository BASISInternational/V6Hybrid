         ****   INSTALLATION GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES  ****


INTRODUCTION

GENERAL Version 4 is a set of files which all begin with the
letters "GEN".  A basic rule of thumb is that all these files
must be installed into a single directory which is accessible to
Business Basic via normal directory searching.  When first
executed, GENERAL will create a subdirectory "TMP" under the
directory where it is installed.  This is used for work files
while reports are being created.  Since GENERAL and the work
files are in the same directory tree, it is necessary that
GENERAL be installed on a file system or disk drive with adequate
space.  As the work files can get quite large, you should
probably have at least 5MB of space available, and possibly more
if your files are large or the number of users who will be
producing reports is high.

MINIMUM PERMISSION REQUIREMENTS

Users who will use GENERAL must have read/write access to the
main directory, and read/write/execute access to the TMP
subdirectory.  In addition, users must have read/write access to
the file GEN4MST, and read access to all other GEN* files.

DICTIONARY MANAGEMENT

GENERAL's dictionary file is called GEN4MST.  It contains not
only file dictionary definitions, but also stored commands and
reports, and user command history.  The media that SDSI ships
contains a basic dictionary file, with definitions for the sample
files included with the package.  This dictionary file is named
GEN4MST.SDS.  Upon execution, GENERAL will see this ".SDS" file,
and will do one of two things:

       If a GEN4MST file exists, the GEN4MST.SDS contents will be
       merged into the existing GEN4MST file, via a simple
       READRECORD/WRITERECORD copy, with overwrite protection.  The
       .SDS file is then erased.

       If no GEN4MST file exists, the GEN4MST.SDS file is renamed
       to GEN4MST.

If this is an upgrade installation that involves a dictionary
conversion, then SDSI will have shipped both the converted
dictionary, as GEN4MST, and the basic dictionary, GEN4MST.SDS. 
Upon first execution, the sample file dictionaries will be merged
with the converted dictionary.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURES

1) Before installing, if you are upgrading, make sure you have a
backup  of the current GENERAL directory, in case something goes
wrong.  If this is a new installation, then you should determine
what directory GENERAL will reside in, and if necessary, create
that directory and establish proper permissions with these
commands:

       mkdir /general-directory
       chmod 777 /general-directory   (on Unix only)

2) Make the GENERAL home directory the current directory:

       cd /general-directory

3) If on Unix, make sure that permissions won't be changed
incorrectly:

       umask 0

4) Download the files.  If more than one media is provided,
download each of them:

       A) Unix: tar xvf /dev/device-name

       B) DOS:  copy a:*.*

5) Uncompress any files that are in compressed format.  

       A) On Unix, these may be in "compress" format, ending in a
       ".Z", or "pack" format, ending in ".z".

              uncompress *.Z, or unpack *.z

       B) On DOS, there may be a self-extracting archive, ending in
       a      .EXE extension.  Just type its name.  If the name is
       UNPACK.EXE:

              unpack

       On DOS, when the extraction is done, you can delete the .EXE
       file.


6) Execute GENERAL as the only user:

       Start Business Basic, with at least 255 pages.  Make sure
       that the GENERAL directory is accessible.  RUN "GEN4"

       GENERAL will execute, performing any dictionary merge or
       rename, as described earlier, and prompt you for a serial
       number and activation key, which has been provided by SDSI.

       Once activated, users can begin using GENERAL.

ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR EXTERNAL DICTIONARIES

GENERAL Version 4 provides real-time support for dictionaries of
Filix, TAOS, and MAS90.  In all cases, GENERAL's internal
dictionary provides enhanced  features that users and developers
may wish to take advantage of.

According to the manual, the only way to take advantage of the
GENERAL dictionary features is to create a complete new
dictionary of the same name in the internal dictionary.  This
would mean that future changes to the file structure would requre
updating the GENERAL dictionary as well as the external
dictionary.

After the manual was printed, however, some enhancements were
developed that allow incremental additions to be placed in the
GENERAL dictionary, while retaining the use of the extenal
dictionary for data definitions.

To establish an incremental dictionary, create a dictionary
element named with a plus sign (+), followed by the name of the
file as defined in the external dictionary.  For example, to add
an incremental dictionary to the MAS90 customer master file, set
up a dictionary name "+AR.CUST".

When defining an incremental dictionary, GENERAL will allow
maintenance of fields, links, and alternate sorts.  The fields
found in the external file are available for use in both the
field expressions and in link key  expressions, and the related
search/paste options include those external fields.

There are two disadvantages to using incremental dictionaries
rather than full internal dictionaries.

       First, GENERAL is optimized for loading its own dictionary,
       but not external ones.  As both are loaded in sequence,
       there is a performance penalty in dictionary maintenance and
       in report parsing (but not in report printing).

       Second, loading both dictionaries requires more memory,
       since both must exists at one time in memory, before they
       are merged.  The merging and manipulation of the two
       dictionaries results in more memory being required.  As this
       will be a workspace issue, a larger START size would take
       care of any error 31's that may show up.


June 21, 1993 - Version 4.03 release enhancement


Version 4.03, in addition to correcting several problems, also includes an
ability to embed link field definitions in a dictionary expression.  These
examples will hopefully make it clear how this is done:

In the DEMO.INVOICE file, a field that looks up the customer name:

DEMO.CUST:NAME
or
"Customer name: "+DEMO.CUST:NAME+"  Phone: "+DEMO.CUST:PHONE


A two level cross reference, to the salesperson file from the invoice file:

DEMO.CUST:DEMO.SLSP:NAME


Here is an example of a summary link definition used in the customer's file:

ID+" "+NAME+" "+STR(@SUM:DEMO.INVOICES:AMOUNT:"###,###,###.00-")


Note that a colon used in the STR() function isn't interpreted as part of the
link.  This is because the parsing looks for the text :" (colon immediately
followed by a quote) and assumes that that isn't part of a link.  This is
the ONLY case where the colon isn't considered part of a link.  Be sure,[
therefore, that all colons are immediately followed by quoted literals.  If
a mask for some reason needs to be a field, like STR(AMOUNT:AMTMASK), then
use a literal null to get the parsing to work: STR(AMOUNT:""+AMTMASK).

The use of link expressions is functionally no different than using the
XREF, TREF, and other ?REF() functions, but it is easier to see what you
are doing, and matches the syntax of the LIST command cross referencing.


September 1, 1993  - Version 4.04 enhancments.

Version 4.04 corrected several problems, provided the base version level
for the port to Thoroughbred 8.1.2 level Basic, and also provided two
enhancements worthy of noting.

In the dictionary, in prior releases, if a disk file name contained a
run-time replacement, the "data assist" (record dump) found in the Fields
maintenance section wouldn't work.  In Version 4.04, the run-time replacement
is replaced, even if it requires a prompt, then the file is opened for
viewing.

GENERAL can now be started from the operating system command line, and
instructed to execute a report under a given user ID.  Earlier releases
allowed this to occur when GENERAL was run in background (as in from cron),
but the system variables were not checked when run in foreground.  This
has been corrected.  If the system variables GEN_GO and GEN_USER are set
to a report name and login user ID, respectively, then the specified report
will be executed automatically, then the task will RELEASE back to the
operating system.  The report name can be a PROMPT report, a saved command,
or a full LIST command.  Naturally, these variables must be "unset" or
set to null for GENERAL to execute normally.

Related to this, under MAS90, a third variable may be set: SOA_COMP.  This
is used when the soafixcomp parameter in GEN4PARM.FIL is set to Y, and is
useful when running reports from MAS90 in background, and no terminal ID
is present to load the default company code from.


NON-DESTRUCTIVE BACKSPACING

A minor feature, of use to sites with wyse terminals or other terminals 
that transmit a backspace character when the left arrow is pressed, is 
the STBL("*GENNDBS").  If this string table is set to "Y", then the
backspace key is interpreted as a left arrow in all scrollable edit windows.
This includes LIST command entry, and the visual modes of PROMPT.

Note that the current BBx termcap file remaps the cursor arrow keys on
wyse 60 terminals, so that this feature likely wouldn't be needed.


NON-BBX SYSTEMS

GENERAL 4.04 is designed to be portable to certain other Business Basic
dialects.  These include Thoroughbred Basic 8.1.2, and Forceb.  There are
some differences in how these products work, and therefore some differences
in how GENERAL works when running under them.

Both Thoroughbred and Forceb have fixed keyboard mapping which overrides
the methods used to allow alternate keyboard maps.  In Forceb, for example,
there is no way to emulate function keys with Escape-1 through Escape-0.
GENERAL, under these dialects, therefore doesn't provide alternate control-
or escape-key sequences.  Instead, the language must completely map the
keyboard, including F1..F10, the standard cursor motion keys, and the
delete character, and insert/replace toggle keys.

The way Thoroughbred handles encrypted programs is less flexible than BBx,
so all serialization and activation must be handled by SDSI.  This means
that upgrade requests to higher user counts require shipment of media, and
associated lead-times.  Please bear this in mind when ordering product or
upgrades.


VERSION 3 FOOTER FORMATS

GENERAL Version 4 provides a more descriptive default footer than Version 3
did.  The footer includes the title of the break point field, the field
value itself, and an aggregate descriptor, such as SUM or AVG.  Version 3
provided only the break point value.  The additional informatino that this
version provides can cause a "vertical" format footer if the fields that
have column calculations are too close to the left margin, and therefore
conflict with the break descriptions.  For new sites, this is generally
preferred, as the report is easier to understand when there is more detail
presented.  For converted sites, however, this can cause some old reports
to format differently than they used to.

Version 4.04 has a new flag in the GEN4PARM.FIL parameter file, called
OLDFTR.  If that parameter is set to "y", then GENERAL will attempt to
create footers that closely match Version 3 footers. 

Alternately, if the parameter is set to "n", then any individual report
can be modified to produce Version 3 footers by adding the keyword V3FTR.

Note that if more than one column aggregate is requested in any column,
then Version 3 footers can't be formatted.  As multiple aggregates weren't
available until Version 4, this would only affect modified or new reports.


VERSION 4.04 SAMPLE FILE NAMES CHANGED

In order to accomodate Thoroughbred 8.x multi-keyed file names, the sample
files had to be renamed to drop the extension (.1, .2, etc.).  The new
names are simple GENSMPL1 .. GENSMPL6.  The master dictionary has been
modified to reflect these new names, but if you have an existing dictionary,
it will still be using the old names and won't find the file when a report
is attempted with the sample files.  To fix this, just modify the disk
file names in the dictionary for all the DEMO.* files, removing the dot
in the file name (GENSMPL.1 changes to GENSMPL1, for example).


FILIX file name requirements

For GENERAL to see Filix files, the Filix home directory must be in the
BBx PREFIX, and the directory where the Filix files are located should
also be in the PREFIX, unless you don't care if Filix files are added
to F2-list files searches.

Since GENERAL searches for dictionaries based on uppercase names, and
also since the parsing routine is affected by slash characters, it is
generally a good idea to quote the Filix file names.  Only if the names
are valid, uppercase, GENERAL dictionary names will it be possible to
not quote them.  This is the case even in PROMPT mode.


Version 4.11 Enhancements

A run-time variable replacement can now reference a STBL (CGV on Thoroughbred).
If tests for looking up the value in the run-time variable table fail, a last
check is made for a STBL value.  [[@COMPID]] will look for STBL("COMPID") if
the variable COMPID isn't found on disk.



A new method for number field masking is now available, which if used will 
supercede the precision, punctuate, and negative masking attributes defined
for a field.  A new type code flag, Mx, causes a check for an stbl named 
"GENMASKx", which must be defined as a complete numeric mask.

As an example, the following code could be executed outside of General:

A$=STBL("GENMASK1","-###,##0.000")

In a General dictionary definition or run-time calculation, the type code of
"N,L12,M1" would cause the GENMASK1 value to be used as the numeric mask of the
variable.


Whenever General needs to lookup a run-time replacement variable
outside of normal report parsing, the current value of the variable
will be looked up rather than forcing a default value of "1", as
in prior releases.  If the variable can't be found, then a "1" will
still be used.  Also, if a run-time prompt (rather than a run-time
variable) is used, then a "1" is still used by default.


A new utility program is available to convert a Basis Taos data dictionary
into a General dictionary, merging fields, links, and sorts with any already
defined for a given file definition.  The utility is GEN4-TDC.UTL.  It has
been designed for dealer customization in some subroutines (lines 7000-8990),
so that name, type code, headings, or expressions can be modified before
being updated in GEN4MST.  As supplied, it includes modifications for
OSAS only.


PROVIDEX Language Printers

Since the Providex environment doesn't have a pre-defined printer 
configuration, there is no way for General to determine available printers
when a given report specifies the ON PRINTER output device.  To get
around this, a special file can be defined in the General directory,
called GENPTRS.PVX.  This is a text file that contains a line for
each printer.  Each line is simply the printer name, a tab or space,
and the maximum number of columns the printer supports in compressed
mode.  A sample file is shipped with "LP 132" and "P1 132" lines.
